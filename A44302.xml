            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Author</hi> of this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe (obſerving the hot conteſts that are too frequently between the neareſt Relations, yea, between ſuch as profeſs Relation to Chriſt; and obſerving the ſtrange ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their diſſentions influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing them to do ſuch things as tend greatly to diſhonour God,) was very much preſſed
<pb facs="tcp:31630:4"/>in his ſpirit to ſeek out ſome <hi>Antidotes</hi> that were proper to cure the fiery Diſtempers of their Spirits, that they might ceaſe affronting God by their furious actings: And indeed God hath directed him to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper methods for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing thereof, if thoſe cholerick Relations would condeſcend to make uſe of the Phyſick here preſcribed. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heart of any Treatiſe that was wholly on this ſubject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I am confident there was never a Diſcourſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this method; none ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing to deal ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb facs="tcp:31630:4"/>and fully with ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Relations as he hath done. The great reaſon that it is ſo difficult to make up breaches between <hi>Men</hi> and their <hi>Wives</hi> is, becauſe they are all averſe to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of their faultineſs; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one conceits him or her ſelf to be wronged. Therefore this Author hath endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to diſcover which of thoſe Relations is moſt in fault when Diſcord doth ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and that ſo the moſt faulty may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereof, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced to a faithful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb facs="tcp:31630:5"/>of reformation. Theſe <hi>Antidotes</hi> are not only proper to cure, but alſo to prevent Diſcord between ſuch near Relations: So it will be of general uſe to all married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. I could heartily wiſh that every profeſſing Family had one of theſe little <hi>Books,</hi> there being in the <hi>Appendix</hi> laid down ſpecial directions for the right ordering of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-concerns both in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Children and Servants, as a ſpecial means to preſerve the peace of Families. O you Husbands &amp; Wives that have
<pb facs="tcp:31630:5"/>felt the ſmart of your furious contentions, be willing to uſe the means to make your lives more comfortable. In this <hi>Book</hi> you will find helps by the bleſſing of God to enable you to take more complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in each other, and to live more peaceably and lovingly together. Be not diſtaſted with the Author for demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating the evil of your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate wranglings for every trifle. Do not any of you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh out reviling ſpeeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, becauſe by his characters you appear moſt faulty when there is Diſcord
<pb facs="tcp:31630:6"/>betwixt you and your conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Relation. What the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath done in this reſpect, is wholly deſigned to put a ſtop to your diſſentions, and to help you to live more peaceably and ſweetly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And if you would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly peruſe the <hi>Book,</hi> you would find it ſo. I need not enlarge in the commendation of the <hi>Book.</hi> When once you have read the <hi>Book,</hi> you will ſee cauſe to commend it your ſelves, and to thank the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor for the pains he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken therein to ſo good an end.
<pb facs="tcp:31630:6"/>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> that thou may'ſt by the peruſal of this <hi>Book</hi> be helpt to a more peaceable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with thy conjugal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, is my hearty prayer: <hi>Farewel.</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe Author of this following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe hath ventur'd farther than any that I have yet met with have gone before him. It's dangerous interpoſing in the differences between Man and Wife, leſt both fall foul upon him for his fair endeavours: the <hi>Man</hi> being ready to be over-careful of his <hi>Free-hold Tenure,</hi> the <hi>Woman</hi> of her <hi>Copy-hold;</hi> and 'tis a venturous act to intermeddle on either ſide. Hence Divines have been ſatisfied moſtly to diſcover the general Duties in their Writings, and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers have undertaken little farther in their Sermons: each Sex being too ready to take offence, or ſcorn or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule any thing that comes very cloſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:31630:8"/>this ſubject. But, <hi>illi robur &amp; aes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>triplex circa pectus erat.</hi>—Our Author fearing neither <hi>One</hi> nor the <hi>Other,</hi> as if he had been made of <hi>Oak,</hi> and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Braſs about his <hi>heart,</hi> hath ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd his paper <hi>Pinnace</hi> amidſt the Waves where two great Seas meet in ſuch violent contentions as are ſtirred up in thoſe miſerable Families where they have ſhut the Fear of God out of doors.</p>
            <p>Such unnatural heats make the life bitter; and, as an Ancient aſſerts, <hi>Proxime ad ignis Infernalis cruciatus, acceder. dolores illos quos ſentiunt quibus diſpar conjugium contiget:</hi> That is in plain Engliſh, <hi>The evil ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of diſparity in the Marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, is next to the torments in Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire;</hi> which every perſon would be willing to prevent if he could, or at leaſt to make the beſt of a bad Market. I would adviſe thoſe that are under the
<pb facs="tcp:31630:8"/>temptation of Family-diſcords, if Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-precepts and examples are nothing with them, and the Divine authority of the Commands of the great God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs nothing upon them, (which would be very ſad and dreadful in the account againſt them at the great Day) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider but the brutiſh policy of a couple of Goats, <hi>that meeting in the midſt of a narrow Bridge they were to paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, had they contended which ſhould give way, they had both fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the water; but one of them fairly lies down, and ſuffers the other to go over him, and ſo they were both preſerved:</hi> And remember how excellent the Moral is of the two em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty earthen Pots that were ſwimming upon the water with this Motto, <hi>Si colledimur, frangimur; If we chance to claſh, we ruine our ſelves, and break one another all to pieces.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:31630:9"/>
            <p>But if the be Families pretending at leaſt to the fear of God, and that have any ſenſe or reſpect for their Redeemer that died for them, let them conſider that Commiſſion given to his Diſciples at their miſſion into the wide world, <hi>Luke 10.5. Into whatſoever houſe ye enter, firſt ſay, Peace be to this houſe; and if the Son of Peace be there, your peace ſhall be upon it; if not, it ſhall turn to you again.</hi> We are to wiſh you peace, and pray for it; invite, exhort, command all Families to keep the peace: and if there be a Son of peace there, or a Son of the God of peace, our counſel will ſtick upon you; but if not, you are but where you were, unſubjected Children of <hi>Belial,</hi> and the peace we wiſhed you will return to us again, to tender it to ſome other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily that will better regard the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our counſel. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this little Book is come abroad,
<pb facs="tcp:31630:9"/>and what entertainment it ſhall meet with in its travels, the event will ſoon diſcover.</p>
            <p>It is too evident that the diſorders in the more ſubordinate parts of the Family, as the <hi>undutifulneſs of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and <hi>diſobedience of Servants,</hi> are occaſioned and fomented by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers in the head and vital parts. Hence this skilful and learned <hi>Family-Phyſician</hi> hath endeavoured the cure and repair of the head and heart of thoſe Families, not troubling himſelf ſo much with the ſmall ſcratches found upon the inferiour members. <hi>Through</hi> the <hi>wiſdom</hi> (of the Head) <hi>the houſe is built, and with underſtanding it is eſtabliſhed, Prov. 24.3.</hi> where this is wanting, that houſe is nigh to deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 12.25. A houſe divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:31630:10"/>
            <p>It were to be wiſhed that Chriſtians (eſpecially under the ties of conjugal Relation) could learn to bear with one anothers infirmities, and ſo fulfil the Law of Chriſt. A cholerick Couple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked, <hi>how he and his Wife liv'd ſo comfortably and ſweetly together?</hi> The man anſwered, <hi>When my Wifes fit is upon her, I yield to her;</hi> and the woman ſaid, <hi>When my Husbands fit is upon him, I yield to him, and ſo we are never angry both at once.</hi> It were well if the one were as <hi>David</hi>'s Harp to appeaſe the fury of the other: It ſeldom proves an unhappy Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the one is <hi>deaf,</hi> and the other blind: the <hi>Man</hi> muſt not always <hi>hear,</hi> nor the <hi>Wife</hi> always <hi>ſee. Love covers a multitude of ſins, Prov. 10.2.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the <hi>Mans</hi> not doing his duty diſcharge the <hi>Wife</hi> from doing hers. <hi>A ſoft anſwer pacifieth wrath</hi> on both ſides.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:31630:10"/>
            <p>But the Author being large in theſe things, I only ſhall commend to you the practice of Domeſtick affairs. And <hi>firſt,</hi> there is a ſinful quietneſs, a meer piece of <hi>Stoiciſm,</hi> when perſons concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with nothing, let things go how they will, having the uſe of no paſſions at all; for even the eveneſt weights are eaſily put into ſome unevenneſs, tho' they tend at laſt to a ſettlement in an even poiſe; and ſo the moſt even and ſedate tempers are naturally prone to ſome little exorbitances, tho' they ſoon return to their quieted centre. <hi>Paul,</hi> a very ſtill man after his Converſion, and became <hi>all things to all men, that he might gain ſome,</hi> (tho' he was a rough piece before) <hi>exhorting them all to meekneſs of Spirit, Col. 3.12.</hi> That <hi>they ſhould put it on as a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> implying, that they had as good go without their Garments, as ſuffer themſelves to be ſtript of this Grace
<pb facs="tcp:31630:11"/>of Meekneſs: yet he could be in a flame, and ſtands up in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and in the open ſtreet reproves their Idolatry. So <hi>Moſes</hi> the meekeſt man, yet he ſhewed he could be moved upon a juſt cauſe, and at the ſight of the Calf he fumes and flies out as if he had been a man made up of Salt and Gunpowder, raſhly throws down the Tables of the Law, and breaks them all in pieces: And Chriſt himſelf, as meek as he was, could take a ſcourge of ſmall cords, and whip the buyers and ſellers out of his Fathers houſe. Stilneſs in not <hi>Stoiciſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There's a holy ſtilneſs or quietneſs of ſpirit, in all conditions, bearing that quietly which we cannot help poſſibly. This is my affliction, and I muſt bear it: It is a Grace of Gods Spirit, Dove-like, like himſelf. Nature can't reach it, Philoſophy can't teach it; Nature is a tetchy piece, full of cholar.

               <hi>Saul,</hi> a turbulent Fellow, no body that feared God could be at quiet for him: But when the Spirit of God came upon him, it made him as tame as a Lamb; and ſo 'twas propheſied, <hi>When the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould be powred forth, the Lion ſhall lie down with the Lamb, Iſa. 11.6.</hi> And it is made the Character of an nunderſtanding man, <hi>He ſhould be of an excellent Spirit, of a cool Spirit:</hi> ſo the Hebrew, <hi>Prov. 7.27.</hi> A cool ſpirit in oppoſition to a hot ſpirit, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpirit, and an excellent ſpirit is a cool ſpirit. Indeed ſome new ſpirits are naturally cool without Grace, as many Heathens were, that had made a conqueſt over their natural tempers by improving their reaſons, and fixing their reſolutions; yet not being from the Holy Ghoſt, it can but paſs for a natural Virtue in them, but never for a ſpiritual Grace.

               <hi>THE</hi> Introduction.</head>
            <p>IT is obſerved, That many Husbands and Wives that are eminent Profeſſors of Religion, yea, ſuch as are truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as well as Profeſſors, through the weakneſs of their Graces, and ſtrength of their Corruptions, do live together in much diſcontent, and that there are often manifeſtations of Wrath and Diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; yea, and many times their paſſions grow to ſuch an height, that in their anger they ſpeak and do ſuch things as do very much diſparage their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and diſcredit Religion, and cauſe the Enemies of Religion to ſpeak evil of the ways of God, becauſe of their diſorderly carriages: Therefore I have endeavoured in the enſuing Diſcourſe to ſhew the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whence uſually Wrath and Diſcord doth ariſe between them, and have ſhewn which of them is moſt faulty when Wrath and diſcord happens. Alſo I have opened the evil of Wrath and Diſcord between ſuch near Relations, and have laid down ſome Rules and Directions how they may
<pb facs="tcp:31630:14"/>prevent it for the time to come, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers motives to perſwade them to uſe thoſe Directions.</p>
            <p>Indeed it hath very much troubled me to obſerve the hot conteſts that have been between ſuch relations, about very trifles; how ſome will be offended, and cannot tell wherefore: They have been of ſuch cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick conſtitutions, that they have enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after occaſions to feed their anger: Alas! how much are ſuch carriages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming the Goſpel! how much do ſuch perſons diſhonour God, and prejudice their own Souls! The conſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath put me upon uſing my weak en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to gather ſuch means out of the Word of God as may prevent their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in ſuch diſorderly carriages; that they may not any longer drink the Waters of <hi>Meriba,</hi> that is of Strife, (their common drink) leſt they find them prove Waters of <hi>Mara,</hi> that is Waters of Bitterneſs, at laſt: I ſhall pray them to ſuſpend their paſſions ſo long, as ſeriouſly to conſider what I have written, that what they find agreeable to Gods Word they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour faithfully to obſerve.</p>

                  <hi>I.</hi> Whence is it that Wrath and Diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> doth ariſe?</head>
               <p n="1">1. ANger and Contention between <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> doth ariſe from a prevailing principle of fleſh in the heart: a fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind produceth much ſtrife, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent paſſionate diſturbances, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>For ye are yet carnal; for whereas there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you envying, and ſtrife, and diviſions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</hi> The meaning is, the fleſh prevails in them more than the ſpirit; the remainders of old <hi>Adam</hi> are very ſtrong in them: that party
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31630:15"/>that is touchy, and takes diſtaſt at every trifle, doth evidence, that much unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied corruption remains in that heart; and I ſay, when diſtaſt is taken at that which is not poſitive ſin, then diſtaſt is taken at a trifle. Now when corruption prevails in the heart, it will break forth, and bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon the tongue, 'tis becauſe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is rotten in heart that he is rotten in language, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.34. you may ſmell the filth of ſome mens hearts by their breath; and it is from this root, from this ground, that ſome perſons are all for ſtrife and debate: hereby ſtrife is the very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein they live, and they live, and love to live, in troubl'd waters, yea alſo in the fire of trouble; they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of contentions. If their fleſhly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was not ſo prevalent, their paſſions would not be ſo violent: and it is ſad when the ſtrongeſt bent of ſome people are for ſtrife, that they can diſcover the boiſterouſneſs of their ſpirits upon every frivolous occaſion; and certain it is, that either <hi>Husband</hi> or <hi>Wife</hi> that is ſooneſt angry with the other, is moſt carnal, for anger, wrath, variance, ſtrife, contentions and hatred, are fruits of the fleſh, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31630:15"/>they are ſeldom ſeparated, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. So that a perſiſting in this diſorder is a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to fulfil the inordinate motions of inbred corruption. Now paſſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is uſually accompanied with carnal emulations, litigious ſtrivings for trifling matters, enmity, variance, a muttering of diſgraceful and opprobrious words: Theſe uſually go together, and raiſe a tempeſt of wrath, and by that violent commotion the perſon is transform'd into a very beaſt; and theſe muſt needs be the fruits of the fleſh, becauſe they are directly oppoſite to the fruits of the ſpirit, which are love, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, meekneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thoſe that bring forth the fruits of the ſpirit are able to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their anger, and can patiently bear, and forgive even many real injuries, and will not be provoked but for ſuch juſt cauſes, and not more or longer than the word of God allows. So that it is evident that one ground of Wrath and Diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch near Relations as <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> is the prevailing of a fleſhly principle in the party that is more paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Self-love is a cauſe of Wrath and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31630:16"/>Diſcord between <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the one party ſo inordinately loves it ſelf, that it hath no true conjugal love for the other, that <hi>he</hi> or <hi>ſhe</hi> never thinks of the injuries and indignities which <hi>he</hi> or <hi>ſhe</hi> offers to the other, or elſe will ſuppoſe them to be none, or elſe lightly eſteem of them as not worthy the recital, on th'other ſide makes the party guilty of this ſelf love or defect of conjugal love, heinouſly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the injuries offered to its ſelf, and ſo make huge Mountains of ſmall Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, and cauſeth its heart eaſily to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the wrong, and to be buſie in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of it, being apprehended, and then longeth for revenge one way or other, wiſhing ſome diſaſter to fall upon perſon, or name, or both of the other, and are glad to be freed any way from the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thinking nothing ſufficient to make amends for ſo great an indignity offered one of ſuch worth as the party fondly and falſly conceits it ſelf to be. And if the ſelf-lover hath not ſo much reſpect given as is expected, is preſently provoked to a furious rage. When a <hi>Wife</hi> is maſtered by ſelf love, ſhe over values her ſelf, and under-values her <hi>Husband:</hi> ſhe can wink
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31630:16"/>at the injuries ſhe offers her <hi>Husband,</hi> and put on ſpectacles of affection when ſhe looketh on thoſe wrongs which are offer'd to <hi>her,</hi> whereby it cometh to paſs that every ſmall matter ſeemeth a great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and provoketh her to great anger; whereas if ſhe thought meanly of her ſelf, and lov'd her Husband as her ſelf, ſhe would not have ſuffered her ſelf to be over-ballanced with the weight of ſelf-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in judging of the injury, nor in giving the reins to her anger to riſe to ſuch an h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight. If the <hi>Wife</hi> had an endeared love for her <hi>Husband,</hi> her love would have more force to reſtrain her from reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reviling her <hi>Husband,</hi> then any injury or ſeeming contempt of her could have to provoke her to anger. For love ſuffereth long, yea ſuffereth all things, and is not provoked to anger, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, 7. The prevailing of ſelf-love, and the cooling and decay of conjugal love, is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe of all diſturbances that are between <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife;</hi> and that party that is moſt paſſionate, hath leaſt conjugal affection; and by want of this love, ſmall matters do exaſperate, and breed diſtaſt: and he or ſhe that is moſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31630:17"/>furious, is moſt faulty: For an <hi>Husband</hi> or <hi>Wife</hi> cannot have a bitter mind upon ſmall provocations againſt one another, if they dearly love one another, and every thing that provokes is a ſmall provocation, which is not a breach of Gods Law: And as they ought not to have a bitter mind, ſo where love is prevalent they cannot proceed to reviling words, or to averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or eſtrangedneſs, or any abuſe of one another. And if a breach or wound be unhappily made, the balſamick quality of love will heal it: ſo that here you ſee that too much ſelf-love, and too little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal love, is another cauſe of diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> and that party that is firſt provoked, and grows moſt furious, is moſt defective in Love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Pride is another cauſe of Wrath and Diſcord between <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife:</hi> for it is the diſeaſed temper of the heart that cauſeth diſſentions, more than occaſions or matters of offence do. A proud heart is troubled and provoked by every word or carriage that ſeems to tend to its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing. A proud Woman is always jealous of her Honour and Reputation, is alſo very ſuſpicious of contempt, ſo that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31630:17"/>the leaſt ſeeming injury provokes her to choler and diſdain, becauſe ſhe is ready to imagine that thereby ſhe is expoſed to contempt. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Only by pride cometh contention, Prov.</hi> 13.10. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that Pride is good for nothing but to cauſe brawling, ſtrife and contention. Pride alone of it ſelf, without the aid of any other thing, is ſufficient to kindle contention; yea, the wiſe man obſerved ſo much Strife and anger to come from Pride, as that he ſeems to ſpeak as if Pride was the only cauſe of all braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: ſo that the leaſt ſpark of anger kindled with the ſmalleſt occaſion, burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out into a raging flame of fire, if it be blown with the wind of pride or ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs. A proud humour that would have all ſtoop to it, if it meet with the leaſt ſeeming ſlight, is preſently hurried with unquiet and turbulent thoughts, which are fit Harbingers to prepare a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the heart to entertain anger: And this is clear from the nature of Pride; for 'tis a fountain-ſin, a root-ſin, productive of many other ſins; it nurſeth, nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and bringeth up many other ſins, and it is the mother of theſe three very bad
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31630:18"/>Children: <hi>Firſt,</hi> It makes men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men boaſt of Themſelves, of their Wiſdom, Parts, Accompliſhments, and their Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as the proud <hi>Jews</hi> did when they were contending with Chriſt: Say they, <hi>We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father:</hi> So ſome will ſay, <hi>I am the Child of ſuch a godly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I was ſuch a mans Son or Daughter, or ſuch a worthy mans Wife, and ſhall I be ſlighted now?</hi> and ſo brings forth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Daughter Contention, and be wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with any one that croſſeth the proud humour, fret at any thing that looks like an undervaluing, fume at, rage at, and revile any perſon that will not be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of their wills, and cannot endure to be hindred from inſulting and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: And this being the humour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Husbands and Wives, it produceth and nouriſheth their paſſions. But the third Daughter of Pride is Contempt. Proud perſons do deſpiſe and vilifie all whom they converſe with: for ſome Wives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe their Husbands in their hearts, as <hi>Michal</hi> did <hi>David,</hi> that let Husbands car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it as obligingly as they can, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Wives do deſpiſe their perſons, they will deſpiſe their actions, and ſo be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31630:18"/>angry with every thing that they do; they do deſpiſe their actions and company too with abhorrency, as the ſtomach doth meat which is offenſive to it, and ſo like their Husbands like ill-ſavour'd meat. From this ground every thing that their Husbands ſay or do is offenſive to them: ſo fly at them with bitter and reproachful words; but the truly humble woman is not provoked to anger, though ſhe be neglected, becauſe her lowly conceit of her ſelf makes her to think that ſhe is not worthy to be much eſteemed, nor yet is ſhe angry, tho' ſhe hath received an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, becauſe ſhe thinks ſhe hath deſerv'd it, either by like faults committed againſt her Husband, or more heinous ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: ſo that it is clear that another great cauſe of that Wrath and Diſcord that is between Husband and Wife, is the pride of that party that is moſt paſſionate; And it is evident from the Scripture, that Pride is the chief ground of ſinful anger, if we read <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.24. <hi>Proud and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſcorner is his name who dealeth in proud wrath.</hi> So much inordinate paſſion as one hath, ſo much pride he or ſhe hath; for pride is as much ſeen in frowardneſs and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31630:19"/>paſſion as in any thing, and there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between ſinful paſſion and pride in every ones heart; and that man or woman that hath a paſſionate ſpirit, hath a proud ſpirit, let them ſeem to be never ſo humble in other things; for the truly humble Soul is of a meek ſpirit, for Chriſt joyns meekneſs and humility together, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly.</hi> I ſhall evidence to you in theſe following particulars how paſſionate and angry perſons are proud perſons, and how pride raiſeth their angry paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Proud perſons are impatient of being contradicted in their ſpeeches, be they right or wrong: You muſt ſay as they do, and not gainſay them. So if paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate perſons be oppoſed in what they ſay or do, they are in a flame preſently. An angry perſon cannot bear the leaſt contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Pride makes perſons unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and cenſorious: They extenuate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons Virtues and good Works, and ſuſpect ungroundedly their ſincerity: They will vilifie others, and give them
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31630:19"/>diſgraceful terms. Thus will paſſionate perſons do: They will judge the party that they are angry with, as a vile, baſe, unworthy perſon, and cenſure him for an Hypocrite, void of all inward and real good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Pride cauſeth men and women to hate reproof. Thoſe that are proud are forward in finding fault with others, but love not a plain reprover of themſelves, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.12. <hi>A ſcorner loveth not one that reproveth him.</hi> They can eaſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be evil, and do evil, but not to hear of it. So paſſionate perſons impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of admonition, they will not endure to be told of their faults: They ſtorm and rail at every reproof that is given them; their ſpirits are too hot to be told of their faults.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Proud ſelf-conceited perſons are ever talkative perſons, and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſpeak than to hear: They will ſuffer none to ſpeak but themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch think always highly of their own underſtandings. So angry perſons rage if any offer to diſcourſe in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; if any preſume to ſpeak, they take exceptions at every word. If their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31630:20"/>paſſions are high, their firſt word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is, <hi>Hold your peace, and ſay no more,</hi> or <hi>be gone out of the Room.</hi> They cannot endure the company of thoſe that will adventure to reply to any thing they ſay: They are too high to be anſwered again, though by their Equals and Superiours, and this kind of paſſionate rage is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Pride.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If proud perſons be wronged, they look for great ſubmiſſion before they will forgive: you muſt lie down at their feet, make very full confeſſion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have your ſelves with very great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or they will never pardon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence you have done them: But if they have wronged others, they are hardly brought to confeſs that they have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and more hardly brought to be ſo humble as to deſire a reconciliation. Thus it is with angry perſons: while anger laſteth, no perſuading them to paſs by a wrong, but if ever they do forgive, it muſt be upon the humbleſt ſubmiſſion that may be, but never acknowledge any wrong that they do: Whatever abuſe they do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to another, is juſtified as well done. Such do think that they can do nothing.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31630:20"/>amis, and thus you ſee how pride, paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and frowardneſs do go together, that a contentious perſon is a proud perſon, and cannot put up injuries, and foul words. <hi>He that is of a proud ſpirit ſtirreth up ſtrife, Prov.</hi> 28.25. What is peoples wrath? what are their ſcorns, their rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and endeavouring to vilifie thoſe that have offended them, but the ſome and vomit of their Pride? It is ſo contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a ſin, that it makes Men and Women firebrands in the Societies where they live: There is no quiet living with them longer than they have their own ſaying, will, and way. They muſt bear the ſway, and not be croſſed; and when all is done, there is no pleaſing them; for the miſſing of a word, or a look, or a complement, will catch on their hearts, and raiſe their fury. As a little ſpark on Gunpowder will make it flame, ſo the leaſt conceit of a diſreſpect offered, doth diſturb their peace, break their ſleep, and caſt them into a Feaver of paſſion. There are ſeldom any hot conteſts between Husband and Wife, but Pride doth occaſion them. All the paſſionate, angry, irreverent, inſulting, and inſolent carriages of a Wife to an Husband, are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31630:21"/>from the pride of her heart, and hence it is that Pride makes Men and Women an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry: Pride makes them think themſelves ſuperiour in worth and goodneſs to any; ſo they think that they are too high to have their wills croſſed by any; and ſay, <hi>Shall I bear ſuch a thing from thee, poor pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Creature?</hi> And then proud perſons think themſelves ſo good, as they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſerve any croſs from another, and that whatever they do, deſerves not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction at all; whereas they are ready to make miſ-interpretations of any thing that another doth, but think that they can juſtifie every thing that they do: So that whatever is done by another that ſutes not with their proud humour, puts them into a fiery paſſion preſently; for proud ſpirits make their wills to be the rule of their actions, and they would have it to be a rule of all other mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too: and ſuch when their wills are oppoſed, cannot but be froward, and highly diſpleaſed. Alſo proud perſons think nothing too mean for others to do, and ſo would fain put their Equals, yea their Superiours, to do ſuch things as they ſcorn to touch; and if they be not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31630:21"/>complied with preſently, they are in a flame of paſſion, and are froward and contentious preſently: and thus you ſee how Pride doth bring forth anger, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and contention.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Fooliſh niceneſs breedeth choler: for if you come into the houſe of one who is nice and curious, you ſhall eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how ſoon ſhe is incited to great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon a little cauſe. I inſtance in the Female Sex, becauſe they are more influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by niceneſs and curioſity than men, and therefore by it they are moſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to fretting diſcontent. If the decking and adorning, ordering and cleanſing of their houſe, be not fully anſwerable to their minds; if a ſpot or wrincle be upon their Garments, they are inrag'd with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that the houſe will ſcarce hold them, or at leaſt not contain their clamorous voices. Thoſe curious folks are not only offended with injuries, but alſo with ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and appearances. Such can carp at Geſtures of the Body that they do not like, and fret at the words of their Husbands becauſe they do not think them reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to them. They judge their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31630:22"/>language ruſtick, and their carriages clowniſh, ſo are in no way genteel enough to pleaſe their humours, and upon this account fall into ſuch a rage of paſſion, as if they had received ſome mortal wound. They are ſo prying and quick-ſighted, that they will eſpy ſome things amiſs, by which they will alarm the whole Family and break their Husbands and their own Peace: If a failing be ever ſo little, they cannot overlook it. and be more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged that ſome ſmall Family-concern is neglected, then that their Family-worſhip is omitted, whereby <hi>they can ſtrain at Gnats, and ſwallow Camels, Mat.</hi> 23.24. They can ſtorm at ſmall offences committed againſt themſelves, and take no notice of great wrongs done to God. Whereas others, who have not their minds effeminated with this nice curioſity, can eaſily paſs over ſuch trifling imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and repel anger in far more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aſſaults: So that a Wifes niceneſs in finding great fault with every frivolous matter, doth occaſion much jarring and hot conteſts betwixt her ſelf and Husband, whereby a ſmall ſpark of diſtaſt doth kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a flame of a violent paſſions.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:31630:22"/>
               <p n="5">V. Lightneſs in believing what comes to the ear, and liſtning to tale-bearers, doth raiſe. Diſcord and Strife between Husband and Wife. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a tale-bearer ſtrife ceaſeth.</hi> So that as wood is the fires fit nouriſhment, ſo is a tale-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer fit to beget and nouriſh anger between Husband and Wife; yea, a tale-bearer doth raiſe contention ſo high, as to make a Separation between Husband and Wife, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A whiſperer ſeparateth chief friends.</hi> When an Husband or Wife gives a credulous ear to the lying ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of a pickthank tale-bearer, they will be incens'd to ſuch rageing anger, that a great matter will not be ſufficient to quench the heat thereof. There have been manifold experiences of great evils which have followed credulity, and liſtning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tale-bearers. <hi>David</hi> giving ear to the falſe report of <hi>Ziba,</hi> was moved to unjuſt anger againſt innocent <hi>Mephibeſheth.</hi> There is no greater firebrand in the world than a tale-bearer. One Neighbour comes to a Wife, and ſaith, <hi>Your Husband was at ſuch a place, ſpent ſo much money there,

Some Wives will ſearch and enquire after mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to feed their paſſions, and enquire of their Servants <hi>What is your Maſter doing? what did he ſay of ſuch a buſineſs?</hi> and if they be informed that he ſaid or did any thing croſs to their humours, or contrary to their approbations, their Spirits are hot preſently, and you may ſee violence and fury in their eyes. If an Husband or Wife will give credit to every ſtory that a tale-bearer brings them, they ſhall never live at peace with one another.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. A peeviſh, froward, humorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is another cauſe of Anger and Diſcord between Husband and Wife, and ſo they will be angry at bare ſurmizes, when it is nothing but a ſurmize or fancy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31630:23"/>that they make and propound to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thereupon let out their anger, like the Dog that barketh at the ſhining of the Moon. Hence many are angry at their own fancy. A pettiſh froward heart will create cauſes of anger to it ſelf, when there are none; nay, the power of their peeviſh and pettiſh humours is ſuch, that they are angry for every thing. Every trifle, every toy, any thing in the world that falls out in the leaſt manner againſt their minds, puts them into an anger. And indeed when Husbands or Wifes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger comes to be common upon every trifle, it makes their anger contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and no one cares for it. Some think to gain more Authority in their Family by their anger, and make others more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to them by it; but in truth it makes themſelves the more deſpiſed. You ſhall find your froward furious perſons, that they will be angry with irrational in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Creatures, and a pettiſh and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Wife will be angry with one for the fault of another: If a Child diſpleaſe her, ſhe will be angry with her Husband. Some perſons have ſuch froward and fretful natures, that they have Gunpowder-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31630:24"/>that as ſoon as any thing diſpleaſeth them they fly in the faces of their neareſt Relations: They are like dry wood that have all the Sap and Juice out of it, as ſoon as ever the fire comes to it is all on a flame: So Husband and Wives that have haſty natures, Sapleſs, and void of true Wiſdom, as ſoon as ever they have any occaſion, but a little fire, a little occaſion, they are all on a fire preſently. Perſons that are of froward and peeviſh diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will manifeſt their anger before any body, never conſiderihg whether it be a convenient ſeaſon. The Husband will vent his anger againſt his Wife, and the Wife vent her anger againſt her Husband, tho' in the preſence of Children or Servants, and through the violence of their paſſions they care not what time they vent their revilings and reproaches: And ſuch furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons will upbraid one another with their failings, whoever be preſent; they will not allow time to confider inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, they are of ſuch haſty Spirits, and ſo will belch forth their paſſionate expreſſions in haſt. Alſo perſons of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick Spirits they have no command of their Spirits to get them down when they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31630:24"/>are once up. Though the winds be ſtill, the waves of the Sea are up and down a great while after: So it is with Husbands and Wives, when there is occaſion to ſtir up their hearts to anger by reaſon of their froward peeviſh natures. Though they have that which ſatisfies them, yet they cannot be quiet for all that, but they are (like <hi>Salamanders</hi>) in the fire continually. There are many Husbands and Wives that have Dog-days all the year long. You know we have Dog-days in one time of the year, but they laſt but a little while; but indeed ſuch Husbands and Wives that have humourſome natures and dogged diſpoſitions, have always Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days: there is nothing but frowardneſs, wrangling and jangling between them all the year long; ſo that in many the heat of anger is in their hearts like the fire of Hell, that is unquenchable: If once their paſſion is up, they will never have done, as if the fire of Hell were in their hearts; and though there may be yielding to them, and a forbearing of all words that may feed their paſſions, yet nothing will quench them: And it is certain, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have ſuffered their paſſion and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31630:25"/>anger to ariſe unjuſtly and fooliſhly, and are convinced in their own conſciences that there is no ſufficient cauſe for their anger, yet they will continue in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and abide in it, that they might not ſeem to others to be angry without a cauſe, and they are loth that the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their hearts ſhould be diſcovered. And alſo it appears that an Husband and Wife is ſway'd by a peeviſh, froward, cholerick nature, when they can let their anger riſe to its utmoſt height for a very little offence, that which would not be taken amiſs at all by a perſon of meek Spirit. Alſo perſons are ſway'd by a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick nature, when they do manifeſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of Spirit in their anger: This bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit conſiſts in this, when one is provoked, and paſſion is up againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they care not what provoking ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they uſe towards others, grating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Spirits ſuch things as they know before, or at leaſt hope will provoke them, and this they do very eagerly: Whereas one of a meek Spirit will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loth to provoke any one; and if there be any means to reform another without manifeſting the paſſion of anger, he will
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31630:25"/>do it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will try all means of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before he will be angry. I ſay, though a meek perſon be juſtly offended by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet if he can reform him with ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of carriage he will do it: but the hearts of many Husbands and Wives are like a Spunge filled with Gall and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; if you do not touch it nothing will come out, but nip it between your fingers and it will preſently come out in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: ſo many hearts, if you do but nip them as it were between your fingers, the Gall will preſently drop down, they will preſently be angry, as it is with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bodies, a cholerick ſtomach will turn all meats, and make them to be bitter to them; and ſo it is with ſuch Husbands and Wives that have cholerick Spirits, the diſtemper of their hearts turn every thing into bitterneſs, and if any thing be done unto them that doth diſpleaſe them, they'll go and chew upon it; and ſo imbitter their own Spirits by thinking what wrong the other hath done him or her. A bitter Pill muſt not be chew'd, but ſwallowed down whole: ſo when there is any thing done amiſs to Husband or Wife, the wrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a bitter Pill, and ſhould be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31630:26"/>down. No marvel if every croſs is ſo bitter if it be chew'd and meditated on. Again, it is evident that an Husband or Wife is maſter'd by a cholerick diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if either of them be of a fierce diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and indeed we may call ſuch <hi>hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd Christians,</hi> that are fierce and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous upon every occaſion. An angry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is more furious when only a ſeeming injury is done to him or her, than when a real injury is done to God: ſo that many times ſome peoples paſſions makes them like a furious mad Dog, that when it ſets on an object it cannot be called back. Oh! the anger of froward peeviſh Spirits is very unruly: ſo that ſuch angry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have not only their paſſions grow to bitterneſs, fierceneſs and unrulineſs, but to Cruelty: they have paſſion without compaſſion; and many times the rage is ſo great, that the Wife (that is ſo much inferiour to her Husband in ſtrength) will not only give provoking ſpeeches, but blows alſo. She will flie at his head, pluck him by the hair, ſtrike him on the face, and throw any thing that ſhe hath in her hand at his head: Indeed here is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a cholerick temper. But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31630:26"/>all the anger of an Husband or Wife that doth not aim at the good of the party that he or ſhe is angry with, is ſinful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and is the effect of a furious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus I have ſhewn you as brief as I might the uſual grounds that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wrath and diſcord between Husband and Wife.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe gratifying an angry paſſionate humour produceth abundance of evil effects. All other paſſions do but draw men and women to evil, but anger doth precipitate them. If any thing be the principle of evil, it is a froward Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is the principle of anger: And therefore let us conſider the eſſects of fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and paſſion, to ſee how much hurt it doth to the Souls of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

                  </gap>n an Husband or Wife is angry, it doth mightily blind the judgment of that party that is ſo, and blind reaſon excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much. The hart of paſſion, the fire of paſſion, when it is kindled, cauſeth a great ſmoak to come up to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and judgment, and even extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh reaſon: Other Paſſions ſtray from Reaſon, but this treads it under feet, and leads it as it were in tryumph. When once ſuch near Relations as Husband and Wife are ſtirred, are froward, and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they do things ſo irrationally, that one can hardly think them the ſame men and women that they are at other times, it doth ſo take away their reaſon. The man or woman that is froward cannot have any counſel, but run headlong, yea, run in a rage to ſuch and ſuch things, and know not what he or ſhe ſaith or doth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe while paſſion is prevalent he or ſhe hath no uſe of reaſon or underſtanding. <hi>Paſſionate perſons are raſh and inconſiderate, they act without deliberation, they run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, Job</hi> 5.14. That is, they go too faſt forward; and they who will not take time to conſult of what they are about to do, may have time to repent of what they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31630:27"/>have done, and all this happeneth becauſe the paſſion of anger cauſeth a ceſſation of the exerciſe of reaſon. Other things may dazle the ſight of reaſon, but this makes it ſtark blind, and for a time maketh men and women as it were diſtracted, and out of their wits. Anger having obtained the ſover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ignty over their minds, taketh away all judgment, counſel, and reaſon, and over-ſwayeth all by fooliſh affection and raging paſſion, and by darkening reaſon. It is a kind of ſhort madneſs, ſaving that here it is far worſe, in that the perſon that is poſſeſſed with madneſs is neceſſarily (will he, nill he) forced to be ſubject to that fury; but a ſinful angry paſſion is entred into wittingly and willingly. Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the evil of Puniſhment, but Anger is the evil of Sin. Madneſs as it were thruſteth Reaſon from its Imperial Throne, but Anger abuſeth Reaſon, by forcing it with all violence to be a ſlave to Paſſion, ſo fit to execute thoſe works of darkneſs in which Rage imployeth it. <hi>Well then, O Husband! or thou, O Wife! ſeeing thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate anger is an injury to humanity, and a Rebel againſt the Government of Reaſon, that it is without Reaſon, and againſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31630:28"/>Remember then that thou art a Man, or Woman, and do thou ſcorn to ſubject thy ſelf to ſuch bestial fury. O with how much attentive care ſhould ſt thou avoid anger: and notwithſtanding provocations offered thee, do not diſturb the quiet of thine own mind. Therefore give not way to anger, ſeeing it blindeth reaſon, which is the light and guide of the Soul. If men abhor Drunkenneſs, and that worthily, becauſe it maketh them differ from bruit Beaſts only in ſhape of body: why ſhould'ſt thou not for the ſame cauſe hate this Vice of Anger, which like a burning Ague doth ſo disturb thy mind, and while the fit laſteth it uttereth nothing but raving? Do not then nouriſh thy froward humour, nor give way to thy wrath. Be not of an haſty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereby thou art guilty of ſuch raſhneſs and fierceneſs in all thy actions, becauſe thoſe furious actings are ſo contrary to right Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another effect of Anger and Diſcord between Husband and Wife is, that they are great enemies to the quiet of their own hearts. An angry paſſion is a great diſturber of a man or womans own peace. That we may ſay of it as the wiſe man
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31630:28"/>ſaith of Cruelty. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.17. <hi>He that is cruel troubleth his own fleſh.</hi> So thoſe that are of froward Spirits, they trouble their own fleſh, and trouble their Spirits too: It doth macerate and vex the Soul with fury; for what greater torment can we imagine, than to have the mind diſtracted upon the Rack of Rage? As therefore we would account him a mad man, who with his own hands ſhould ſet his houſe on fire, and conſume it, alike mad is that perſon to be thought, who will ſet his or her Soul on fire with the rageing flame of anger, wherein it is not only tormented in this life, but alſo (without Repentance) in the life to come it ſhall be tormented everlaſtingly. Rage and fury tortureth more than wrong or injury! Hereby men and women prove burdens to themſelves, and hence it is that an angry Husband or Wife cries out, <hi>No one is ſo plagu'd as I am, I know no body ſo croſt as I am,</hi> becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are plagues to themſelves and croſſes to themſelves, they having no quiet in their own Spirits, nothing without is quiet to them. If we could look into the bofom of an angry perſon we ſhould find that there is no ſuch diſcontented Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31630:29"/>as an angry Spirit is; ſuch an one would fain have his or her own will; but ſailing herein, in ſpight of his or her heart there will be nothing but confuſion and trouble in his or her Spirit. Immoderate anger hath proved an enemy to the body it ſelf: it inflameth the blood, ſtirreth up diſeaſes, and breedeth ſuch a bitter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſedneſs in the mind as tends to conſume the ſtrength of Nature, and hath caſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into accute, and many into chronical ſickneſſes, which have proved their death. And how uncomfortable kind of death is this? Well then, let the party that is moſt overcome by this paſſion ſay, <hi>What good do I get by this paſſion? What! had it not been better for me to have put up this wrong, than endure ſuch vexation to my ſelf, and be guilty of doing my body ſo much prejudice as to cauſe me (if I continue my anger) to fall into the Diſeaſes of Melancholly, Frenzy, Madneſs, Apoplexy, Palſie, and Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are the uſual effects of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Diſtemper of furious paſſion? O then ſhall I be angry upon every trifling occaſion, and offer my body and ſpirit ſuch great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? No, I will not; for I cannot pretend to hope for any inward or outward comfort by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31630:29"/>my anger; nay, my paſſion doth not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the health of my body, but mightily deform my body: it deforms my countenance, and takes away the amiable ſweetneſs of it, which appeareth in a calm and loving tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. I ſhould loath my ſelf, ſhould I view my Picture while I was in my fury, before the frowning wrincles and inflamed blood had returned to their place, and had left my vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to its natural comlineſs. Is it not then better to forget injuries, paſs by wrongs, bear with ſome oppoſition, and deny the gratifying of my will, than do my Body and Spirit ſo much prejudice, and loſe that contentment and ſweetneſs, that by meekneſs I might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and loſe that inward peace and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mind that otherwiſe I might have, or deprive my ſelf of that beauty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that otherwiſe I might preſerve? O then, God forbid that I ſhould gratifie my angry humour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. An angry perſon is very troubleſom to others, even to the whole Family where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that angry perſon dwells, and all thoſe that do converſe with him or her, When the Husband or Wife is angry or froward, O how extremely burdenſom is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31630:30"/>he or ſhe to that Family; that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith in two places, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.9, 19. that <hi>it is better to dwell on the houſe-top, or in the Wilderneſs, than to dwell with a brawling woman in a wide houſe.</hi> She is ſuch a vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all thoſe with whom ſhe dwels. He inſtanceth in a woman, becauſe that Sex is moſt ſubject to this brawling kind of life: They are moſt apt to be angry and contentious. An angry Husband or an angry Wife is a torment to all thoſe that live in Family; and therefore the Holy Ghoſt by <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.24. <hi>Make no friendſhip with an angry man, and with a furious man thou ſhalt not go.</hi> There is no good to be gotten by the company of one that is uſually angry upon every trifling occaſion: There is no peace to be enjoyed in angry perſons company. A froward Spirit troubles his own houſe; and conſider what is ſaid of ſuch an one in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.29. <hi>He that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth his own houſe, ſhall inherit the wind:</hi> that is, as he or ſhe hath been a trouble to his or her own houſe, ſo God ſhould blaſt that perſon in all his or her ways. Indeed paſſion is ſo troubleſom between Man and Wife, as they can hardly dwell
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31630:30"/>together under one Roof, becauſe they ſpend a great part of their life in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling one another. By their paſſions they are vexatious to one another, and in their houſe it is ſtormy weather all the year long, that it is a very rare thing to enjoy any calm weather in the Family where angry perſons dwell. Hence it is that Husband and Wife can ſeldom eat their meat together at one Table without quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, becauſe their lives are ſo uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable one to another, their company is very uncomfortable to others. Paſſion is an unruly thing, and therefore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom where-ever it comes. And wilt thou then, O Husband or Wife! cheriſh that evil humour in thee, that will make thee a burden to all that converſe with thee? If thou continueſt to be angry upon every ſlight oppoſition or contradiction, thou wilt be had in contempt of all that are near thee: they will deſpiſe thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe thou doſt break their peace, and depriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> them of their quiet. So then if thou haſt any deſire to preſerve the peace and quiet of thy houſe, and have any eſteem of thoſe that live with thee, do thy utmoſt endeavour (by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:31630:31"/>of the Spirit) to mortifie thy angry paſſions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The prevailing of anger and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention between Husband and Wife doth deſtroy their love: there is thereby a great decay of the affection of love, and an augmentation of the paſſion of hatred. Anger makes perſons guilty of ſlighting, deſpiſing, diſreſpecting and undervaluing thoſe they ſhould highly value, love and eſteem; and this appears in the following particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. When perſons are enrag'd that Gods Providences do thwart their humours, they are offended and diſpleaſed with God, and their love to God doth very much abate; for where love to God is ardent and prevailing, there every Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential act of God is kindly accepted, and taken in good part. Such perſons as love God, are well pleaſed with every diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of God, and are contented with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very condition God puts them in: but when they are offended that God doth not give them every thing according to their own will, when they do not like of Gods
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31630:31"/>diſpoſing of them in this relation, or in this condition of life, and in this place of habitation; and begin to vex and fret themſelves, be angry, and in a furious paſſion, that God doth not order things to their liking. Then their murmurings and repinings, their vexing and fretting, their diſguſt and diſcontent, their anger and diſpleaſedneſs of mind, doth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly abate their affections to God. They begin to diſreſpect God more and more; they entertain conceits as if God did do them wrong in not ordering all things according to their humour; in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger murmur that God yoked them to ſuch Conſorts, wiſhing that God had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe diſpoſed of them. And knowing that all conjugal Relations are of Gods ordering and appointment, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain highly as if he had dealt injuriouſly with them in appointing ſuch a Relation for them; and hereupon their love to God declines, and they care not for Gods company, ſlight thoſe duties and ſervices wherein they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight converſe with God, and are more diſpleaſed with the ſeeming offences they pretend are done them by their Husbands and Wives, than for the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31630:32"/>neglect of Gods worſhip, and indeed love grows cold to one whoſe company is not delighted in, for all perſons take delight to be much in company of their beloved, and when Gods company is not prized, he is not loved.</p>
               <p>Now, ſeeing anger and diſcord doth leſſen peoples love to God, it muſt needs be the greateſt evil, as it doth cauſe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of love to the chiefeſt good. The want of love to God is the moſt comprehenſive and odious ſin, it is the life of all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſins. To be defective in love to the God of love, the fountain of love, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of the Soul, is a ſin not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to any till it be repented of, and partly cured. <hi>Therefore ſtay, O man, or O Woman! to what an height doth thy angry paſſion make thee to aſcend? Doſt thou not tremble to think how much thou doſt provoke God, when thou doſt in thine anger ſlight and diſreſpect God, and art angry with God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art diſpleaſed with thy Husband or with thy Wife, and becauſe Gods Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do not ſute thy humour. If his anger be dreadful when kindled but a little, what is it then when kindled very much? Here is the ſad effect of thy being angry with thy
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31630:32"/>Husband or Wife: thou then venteſt thy fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward humour upon God, and beginneſt to quarrel with God for ordering ſuch a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for thee, and beginneſt to abate thy reſpects to God, and careſt not to exerciſe thy ſelf in thoſe exerciſes wherein thou mayeſt enjoy Gods company. Do not then feed thy angry paſſions, whereby thy heart is ſo much eſtranged from God, and whereby you thruſt God from your hearts. Oh how ſhould'ſt thou loath thy violent paſſions and contentions, when thou conſidereſt how they deaden thy affections to God! May not God juſtly thruſt thee from his preſence, when by thy wrath and fury thou doſt thruſt him frrom thy heart? If thou would'ſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in thee a principle of prevailing love to God, endeavour after meekneſs and quietneſs of Spirit. As Husband and Wife are the neareſt Relations, let them not be jarring and quarrelling one with another.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The prevailing of furious angry paſſion in a perſon doth abate true and real love to it ſelf, By the raſhneſs and inconſiderateneſs of peoples wrath, they manifeſt no pity to themſelves: Through the violence of anger how many have been cruel to themſelves! they wound

If thou didſt really love thy ſelf, thou wouldſt carefully avoid whatever did prejudice thy ſelf; thou wouldſt faithfully watch againſt every thing that would break thy peace, or deprive thee of thy amiableneſs, or deform thee with a tart, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Thy paſſions do cauſe others to ceaſe manifeſting reſpects to thee; they make others to ſlight thee, and ſhun thee.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Anger will abate thy love to the perſon that thou art angry with. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of thy love to the party with whom thou art angry, doth appear in miſ-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting his actions in the worſt ſenſe, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing contention from ſuſpicion or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, inventing cauſes of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure where none are. Thus by anger charity is notably violated, for love ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth all things, therefore their love is ſmall that will ſuffer nothing. Love co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth a multitude of ſins, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that find faults where they are not, rather than cover them where they are, do plainly ſhew their want of love to the party with whom they are angry. It is the nature of love to make <hi>great</hi> faults
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31630:34"/>ſeem <hi>little,</hi> and <hi>little</hi> faults <hi>none at all:</hi> but when a perſons anger makes every ſlip in his or her Friend or Relation a capital offence, then there appears a great decay of love. When a perſon apprehending it ſelf highly wronged by another, doth preſently begin to ſlight that party, that perſon doth manifeſt more diſpleaſure againſt the perſon he or ſhe is angry with, than the offence, and hath no love at all for him. Such is the violence of paſſion, that there is ſcarce any other affection ſo ſtrong, which it doth not eaſily ſubdue. Love is ſaid to be ſtronger than Death; yet anger, if it be once admitted to rage, eaſily overcometh it: Perſons then forget the love of the Relation that they are in. In anger Wives ſpeak to their Husbands as if they had no kind of ſuperiority at all, or as if God had not ſet them over them any way; ſo own neither ſubjection or reverence to be due unto them, and ſo cauſeth them, inſtead of the duties of love, to bring forth the fruits of hatred. When the furious flame of anger is kindled in the hearts of ſome people, they care not what reproach they caſt upon, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prejudice that they do unto thoſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31630:34"/>that they ſhould love as themſelves. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is the evil effect of anger, that it inclineth perſons to hurt them that make them angry, that it putteth hurting thoughts into their minds, and hurting words into their mouth, and inclineth them to think, or do ſome miſchief. <hi>And wilt thou favour that paſſion that tends to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh thy love to thy neareſt and deareſt Relation, that makes thee neglect to manifeſt thoſe reſpects that be long to thy Husband or to thy Wife? If thou art a Wife, anger will put thee upon uſurping authority over thy Husband, denying ſubjection to him that the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If thou wert humble and meek, thou wouldſt not be of ſuch a captious, contentious and wrangling diſpoſition, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-look thoſe failings that provoke proud ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is evident how anger hath a tendency to extinguiſh the love of God, for the love of God will not kindle and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31630:35"/>flame in an unquiet breaſt. It makes men and women fret againſt God, and murmur at his Providences, and makes them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with that ſtate, and Relation he hath put them into, and that it abates peoples love to themſelves, and makes them deſperate in their ways, makes them ready to miſchief themſelves, that is, makes them run upon ſuch ways and courſes as are likely to prove miſchievous to them, without all love or pity to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Be not then ſuch an enemy to thy ſelf, as to nouriſh ſuch fiery paſſions in thee, as will do thy ſelf the greateſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. Alſo anger abates peoples love to their neareſt Relations, makes them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain jealouſies and ſuſpicions which feed their anger, makes them take in ill part every light action, and ſo their hearts grow eſtranged from their deareſt friends, and have their neareſt Relation in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. <hi>Thou then that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In thoſe that are guilty of much fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious paſſion, their anger doth cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſin, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.22. <hi>An angry man ſtirreth up ſtrife, and a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.</hi> Anger is the door and gate of Vice, and therefore the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.8. <hi>Ceaſe from anger, leave off wrath, fret not thy ſelf to do evil;</hi> as if he would imply that to abound in anger is to abound in ſin, and it cannot be but a perſon muſt be guilty of much ſin, that lives in fretting paſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unreſt. More ſin is committed by a perſon in a fit of paſſion in one quarter of an hour, than a meek-ſpirited man commits in a quarter of a year. <hi>Moſes</hi> in his zeal for God broke the two Tables of Stone whereon the Law was written, and ſometimes paſſionate and angry peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their wicked heats of ſpirit break all the ten Commandments, and in moſt fits of paſſion they break in pieces moſt of the Commandments of the ſecond Table. Peoples vile, wicked and ſinful luſts, when they are pleaſed, ſtir not. But when once

When there is a Land-flood that the Brooks get over the banks, and over-flow the Meadows, they carry with them a great deal of ſoil, and a great deal of filth.</p>
               <p>Thus it is in an over-flowing of all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but eſpecially in the over-flowings of the affection of anger there comes a great deal of filth along with it; for when once by rage the eye of reaſon is blinded, the angry perſon is eaſily led into a gulph of all wickedneſs. <hi>He that is of an haſty ſpirit exalteth Folly, Prov.</hi> 14.29. that is, exalteth wickedneſs. When perſons are quick, and ſhort of ſpirit, they are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into many indecencies, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God, and wound their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If men and women do not check their precipitant motions, by delay and due recourſe to reaſon, they will be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of abundance of wickedneſs.

               <p n="6">6. Husbands and Wives by the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their angry paſſionate fits make themſelves all their lives contemptible to others. Some Husbands and Wives think to be terrible to others in their paſſion, but they diſcover ſo much folly, as that they make thoſe that they are angry with to deſpiſe them: They may think to gain the more authority, and make others ſtand more in awe of them, by their being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them; but they ſee ſo much raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtemper in their paſſion, that nothing deprives them of their authority &amp; reſpect more than this conſtant paſſion of anger, when ſmall matters puts them into a fiery ſit. Indeed if perſons did but obſerve their ſhameful carriages when they are in paſſion after they were come to their right minds, and in a calm frame of ſpirit did but conſider how much they were diſdained and contemned for it, it would make them aſhamed of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. However, many are angry becauſe they would not be deſpiſed, but keep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in ſubjection to them; yet nothing in truth doth work baſe eſteem and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard in the minds of thoſe that they are

Frequency of Husbands and Wives paſſionate fits migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily blazeth abroad, and diſcovereth their ſhame and folly, which occaſioneth their contempt, as Wiſdom cauſeth Honour and Reſpect. When Husbands and Wives an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and (the effects thereof) clamorous brawling, and ſometimes fighting, are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and common, as well for trifles as weighty matters, perſons do deſperately contemn both, when they have no hope to prevent either. <hi>If thou, O Husband, or O Wife, would'ſt have the better'dneſs of thy diſpleaſure, have any effectual operation upon the mind of the party with whom thou art diſpleaſed for the purging away faults and vices, thou muſt manifeſt thy diſpleaſure as the Phyſicians adminiſter ſtrong Phyſick, only upon extraordinary caſes; for if Phyſick be commonly taken, it will have no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary effect. If thou doſt habituate thy ſelf to the uſe of Phyſick in a common way, as thou dost thy food, it will not benefit thee in times of ſickneſs; ſo if thy anger be frequent and common, it will neither do good to thy ſelf or another; it will not be regarded.</hi> The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent brawlings of an angry perſon do

That perſon that will not let paſs any rumour or report that is ſpread of him or her, without reaſonings and ſtir, doth expoſe him or her ſelf to the more reproach: for they that cannot rule their own ſpirits, deſerve no reſpect, becauſe (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.28.) <hi>He that hath no rule over his own ſpirit, is like a City broken down, and without walls;</hi> who is able to defend himſelf againſt no aſſaults, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one ſlights him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If an Husband or Wife doth manifeſt much paſſion, frowardneſs, and diſcontent againſt the other, the prevailing of ſuch corrupt humours will hinder the angry, froward, and diſcontented, contentious, wrangling perſon from doing any good. A perſon in a froward temper is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly indiſpoſed to any good work. When thou wilt ſeem to aim at the glory of God, and yet wilt ſhew thy ſelf very paſſionate, know God hath no need of thy wrath: It is true he hath need of thy Zeal, but that is not thy wrath and paſſion, to break out in outragious ſpeeches, or railing bitter language; God hath no need of this wrath of man. Let perſons have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p n="1">1. The prevailing of anger in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the indulging and gratifying an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous ſpirit, indiſpoſeth them to do good to themſelves. Angry perſons will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to commune with their own hearts, and to conſider their own ways, or to ſearch out their own diſorders of life. The Wife is ſo tranſported with diſguſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Husband, that ſhe apprehends to have diſpleaſed her, that ſhe can think of nothing, or talk of nothing, but what may vilifie or reproach her Husband; ſhe will not do ſo much good to her ſelf as to try whether thoſe carriages correſpond with the Divine rule, whether ſhe can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie what ſhe ſaith or doth to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band by a warrant from Gods word. She will not conſider whether ſhe hath not been tranſported into indiſcreet and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent exceſſes, or whether ſhe would not have condemned ſuch violent heats in

Peoples frowardneſs and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hinders them from doing good to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to farther the convincing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the evil that they have done, and bringing them to repentance for it. <hi>And wilt thou then dare indulge thy angry paſſions, that make thee uncapable of doing thy ſelf good? Moſt men aim at ſelf-intereſt, ſelf-advantage, and ſelf-applauſe; but thou by thy paſſions doſt diſable thy ſelf from doing any act advantagious to thy ſelf, either to promote thy ſpiritual good, preſent profit, or preſent credit. Surely that temper of ſpirit muſt needs be very evil, that hinders thee from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to thy ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Thy frowardneſs and angry paſſion, thy contentious wrangling ſpirit hinders from doing any ſpiritual good; it indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thee for performance of any ſpiritual duty to God; it makes thee averſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, and unfit to ſerve God in a right manner; it is an hindrance of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prayer. Angry perſons cannot call upon God in a ſerious ſpiritual manner, becauſe their hearts are carnal, earthy,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31630:40"/>and poyſoned with ſelf-love; nor will God hear them if they call upon him. Anger hinders perſons in all ordinances, it makes them the moſt unfit perſons in the world for to pray: therefore the Apoſtle ſaith in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>I will therefore that men pray every where.</hi> How? <hi>lifting up holy hands, but without wrath. O Husband! or O Wife! thou muſt be ſure when thou lifteſt up thine hands to prayer, that there be no wrath in thy ſpirit, that thou do not go to prayer in a paſſion.</hi> Angry paſſionate Prayers are vain Prayers. The Lord loveth zeal, and much warmth of affection in prayer, but he cannot abide wrath or the leaſt ſpark of paſſion in prayer; a peaceable heart is as neceſſary in prayer, as a pure hand. When a Wife coming to God in prayer, hath I know not what wrathful diſputes within her ſelf againſt her Husband, how can ſhe look for a gracious acceptance with God? the like may be ſaid of the Husband. Will the Lord be pleaſed with thoſe that nouriſh ſecret diſpleaſure againſt their neareſt Relation? No, no, furious and unquiet thoughts muſt be laid down by thoſe that would have favour with God, and compaſſions from God. If perſons
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:31630:41"/>would compaſs Gods Altar, and there of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up the Sacrifice of Prayer and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, they muſt firſt <hi>waſh their hands in innocency, Pſ.</hi> 26.6. And our Saviour Chriſt commandeth, that <hi>before perſons offer any gift unto the Lord, that they ſeek to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the party with whom they are diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Mat.</hi> 5.23. So long therefore as any continue in their anger, they are unfit to pray; and this appears moſt manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the fifth Petition of the Lords Prayer, where we deſire <hi>to be forgiven as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, Mat.</hi> 6.12. And again, our Saviour Chriſt doth ſingle this out of all the other Petitions; but if you will not forgive men their treſpaſſes, no more will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes. They who are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for and expecting favour and mercy from God, have need to diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all wrath and diſpleaſure towards men. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in the 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 3.7: exhorts Man and Wife <hi>to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love, that their prayers be not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</hi> Jarrings between ſuch Relations do hinder their praying together to any good purpoſe; therefore if you would be fit to go to God together for mercy and favour, beware that you carry no wrath
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31630:41"/>in your hearts towards one another, for then you will be ſent empty away: And is not that a very great evil, and too bad to be harboured in the hearts of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Wives, that will hinder them from enjoying fellowſhip and acceptance with God in prayer, that will either make them ceaſe to pray together, or if they do pray will make their Prayers vain and fruitleſs, as paſſion and diſcord uſually doth? Alſo anger and diſcord is a very great evil in hindering Husbands &amp; Wives to do good, by unfitting them to come together to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. I queſtion not but many angry Husbands and Wives are convinced in their own conſciences that they ought not to come to the Sacrament in a paſſion, when they are angry with one another; they know they muſt lay aſide wrath and malice then, and be in charity with all perſons. Hence many Husbands &amp; Wives will rather loſe a Sacrament, than come in a paſſion. Many will ſay, <hi>I could not come to the Sacrament becauſe my Husband and I fell out, or my Wife and I fell out:</hi> Now this is a vile thing, that when there is a Sacrament that Men and their Wives
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31630:42"/>are convinced that they ought to come unto, but the breaches that are between them hinder them. So many men and women by giving way unto their paſſions are unfit to hear and read the word, unfit for any act of obedience of the Divine Will, unfit for any act that hath a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote the Glory of God. So that the violence of paſſion doth hinder Men and Women from doing of any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good.</p>

Paſſion and frowardneſs doth hinder Husbands and Wives from doing good to one another, in diſables them from admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing one another of any fault, becauſe an admonition is to be adminiſtred in a ſpirit of meekneſs. A furious perſon is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unlikely to convince another of ſin, neither hath ſuch an one any heart to give another whom he or ſhe is diſguſted with, any ſpiritual counſel. That ſecret prejudice which is harboured in the angry perſons breaſt, hindereth him or her from doing any offices of love for his or her neareſt Relation; but inſtead of doing ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation good, will do him or her the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt prejudice that may be done. Angry
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:31630:42"/>perſons are no way ſervicable to the good of others, rather offering indignities than kindneſſes to them. Here is a ſore evil indeed, that angry Husbands and angry Wives are neither ſerviceable to God, themſelves, nor one another. <hi>O then do not let thy paſſion rage for every trifle: thou then makest thy ſelf unfit either for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God or man; and what a ſad thing is it to be a uſeleſs Creature, not capable of doing any good! Oh then it is a ſad and ſore evil to be an angry, paſſionate, froward, and contentious perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Anger, paſſion and frowardneſs of ſpirit hinders perſons from receiving any good. A froward ſpirit is unfit to take in any good; there is no dealing with angry and froward Spirits when they are in their fits, as there is no Phyſick to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a man when he is in the heat of his Feaver, ſo there is no meddling with angry perſons when they are in a flame: You muſt come to them when they are quiet, or elſe you will not be able to do them any good; and indeed this is the horrible diſtemper of this paſſion, that God and man muſt ſtay till it be down,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:31630:43"/>that God ſhould not only wait on perſons to do them good, but alſo wait upon their wicked, vile, baſe Luſts, that he muſt ſtay till they are over before they are fit to hear him ſpeak to them. Now it is a meaner thing to wait upon a perſons hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, than to wait upon the meaneſt Creature in the world. When the fire of anger is kindled in peoples hearts, they are fit to hearken to nothing; their ſouls are on fire, and not fit to hear any thing: thus mens angry paſſions hinder them from receiving good. And angry perſon is impatient of admonition, which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God as a means of their recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from ſin. Angry perſons will flie in the face of a reprover; they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to have their ways and actions found fault withal; the more you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to convince them of their ſin, the more they are exaſperated; the more you perſuade them from their evil courſe, they grow the more furious in their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are not fit to receive any good counſel; while they are angry they are obſtinate and reſolute; if you ſmite with a Reproof, 'tis as if you had ſtruck upon an Anvil, it makes no impreſſion on them.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31630:43"/>And alſo anger is the cauſe that the word of God becometh unprofitable. Anger cauſeth men to entertain the truths of the word of Life, as wind in the ſtomach doth wholſom meat, that will not ſuffer it to enter. Thoſe that will benefit by hearing Gods word, <hi>muſt be ſlow to wrath, James</hi> 1.19. For anger hardens the heart, that the Seed of Life cannot take root, or leave impreſſion, yea it makes reſiſtance to the Work of Grace. Thoſe Spirits in whom there is a wrathful fierceneſs, riſe up in rage againſt the Word of God. Angry Spirits think that the Miniſter raileth, when he doth but diſcover their guilt to them; ſo peoples paſſions ſtir them up many times to a fierce oppoſition of the Truth; but let ſuch conſider, that their perverſe oppoſition with be their ruine, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. <hi>they rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves,</hi> that is, to their own loſs. Though anger may not altogether hinder or keep them back from hearing, yet it will fully hinder them from pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; for then only perſons receive good by the Word, when they practice what they hear, when they are <hi>doers of the word, and not hearers only. O Husband! or O
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:31630:44"/>Wife, doſt thou obſerve what an hindrance thy froward and paſſionate ſpirit is to thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving good? Indeed it is a ſore evil to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge thy ſelf in that humour, which reſiſteth thoſe means that ſhould do thee good, whereby tho receiveſt no benefit by any means that is uſed for thy good; yea, the allowing thy ſelf in thy paſſions doth deprive thee of the good thou hadſt before; thou art not only hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from receiving more good, but thou ſhalt loſe even what thou haſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is reported that ſome Pearls may be diſſolved by Vinegar; ſo there are many excellent things in men and women, but they are diſſolved by the Vinegar of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Vinegar of paſſion doth ſtain the ſpirits of men and women, and cauſeth them to loſe that Beauty that they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yea, to loſe much of the ſweetneſs of the enjoyments of God himſelf, yea, it makes them loſe the ſenſe of Divine Love. As we cannot diſcern the Sun when we are near a ſcorching fire, ſo the Heavenly heat of Divine Love is not felt, if the furious flame of anger be kindled in peoples hearts. Froward Chriſtians have little ſenſe of Gods love towards them. <hi>O then,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31630:44"/>O Husband! or O Wife! Do thy continual brawling hinder thee from receiving good by admonitions, counſels, and all ordinances, and make the means of Grace ineffectual to thee? Do they deprive thee of the good thou haſt, and deprive thee of the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance? Do they cauſe the withdrawing of the light of Gods countenance? O then, what an evil thing is it for thee to be angry with thy Husband or thy Wife upon every trifle!</hi> Thus I have opened the great evil of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions between Husband and Wife, in ſhewing the evil effect of their anger and diſcord between each other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider, O Husband! or O Wife! Anger is a ſore evil, becauſe thy angry fits of paſſion do grieve the ſpirit of God. Though by venting the froth of thy froward paſſionate ſpirit thou may'ſt pleaſe thy ſelf, yet thou grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the Holy Spirit. It is an ill thing to grieve thy friend; and indeed none are more grievous to their deareſt Friends and neareſt Relations, than froward and paſſionate people. When thy Friend comes to thy Family, and ſees thee in a froward and paſſionate temper, it grieves him, and thou grieveſt the heart of thy Husband: It may be alſo he goes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:31630:45"/>of it to God, and thou grieveſt thy Friend, and he complains of it: but this is worſt of all, thou grieveſt the ſpirit of God. When thou art in a fit of paſſion, the Spirit of God goes away to Heaven ſadly, as it is in</hi> Epheſ. 4.30, 31. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God. Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all malice. <hi>The Apoſtle unto that command,</hi> grieve not the Spirit, <hi>immediately ſubjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this,</hi> let all bitterneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; <hi>intimating that otherwiſe they could not ceaſe from grieving the Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are mentioned various degrees of anger, and every one of them doth grieve the Spirit. By <hi>bitterneſs of Spirit</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the loweſt degree of ſinfui anger, and alſo by <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> is underſtood all ſecret ſmothered diſpleaſure, and alienation of affection, which hath more of diſcontent and grudge than of revenge. The next degree is wrath, or fierceneſs of Spirit, which is an impetuous rage, and paſſionate commotion of the heart and affections, upon the ſenſe of an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded injury, preventing and obſtructing the uſe of reaſon; and in ſome it grows to a deſire of revenge, and a fixed reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:31630:45"/>after deliberation to have that deſire ſatisfied. In ſome anger breaks out into boiſterous words, loud menaces, and other inordinate ſpeeches, which are the black ſmoak whereby the fire of anger and wrath, kindled within, firſt manifeſts it ſelf, and then anger proceeds to evil ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, uttering diſgraceful and contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpeeches, by which the party incenſed doth endeavour to ſtain the reputation of him who hath ſeemed to have offered him or her a wrong: Of this ſort was <hi>Saul</hi>'s anger, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.30. Now all and every degree of anger doth grieve the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and darken much the Work of Grace in the heart; there being no ſins more oppoſite to <hi>the fruits of the ſpirit</hi> mentioned in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. Then thoſe ſins are ſo, that where ſuch ſins are given way, Grace muſt needs be on the decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand. O the prevalency of ſinful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is very injurious to the Spirit of God! it grieves the Spirit ſo much, that he will withdraw his motions, his guidance, aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and comforts from angry perſons. <hi>O then, if thou would'ſt not grieve the Spirit of God, lay aſide all bittereſns, wrath, and anger,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Conſider what an heinous evil
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:31630:46"/>anger, wrath, and frowardneſs of Spirit is. Thou doſt not only by thy paſſion grieve thy Friend or near Relation, but alſo the Spirit of God: and wilt thou be ſo ungrateful as to grieve that Spirit that hath done thee ſo much good, that is appointed by the Father and by Jeſus Chriſt to be thy Comforter, even the Comforter of thy Spirit. If thou hadſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Spirit, thou would'ſt think it an ill thing to grieve thy Friend, and if thou hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou haſt done that which hath grieved him, in will grieve thee exceedingly.

               <p n="3">3. O Husband! or O wife! by thy gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to exceſſive anger, thou doſt <hi>give place to the Devil, Epheſ.</hi> 4.27. Thou doſt caſt open the doors to Sathan, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital enemy of thy Soul, to enter thy heart, and incite thee by his unceſſant ſuggeſtions to act ſome miſchief. As Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is dethroned and ſhut out of the hearts of all true believers, and though he ſhall never reign over them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:31630:46"/>yet he is daily watching &amp; ſearching out, if it were but the narroweſt paſſage, and leaſt opportunity, whereby he may again re-enter his old poſſeſſion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his former Tyranny: and where exceſſive or ſinful anger is not only given way to, but alſo continued in, there doth Sathan get an open door to ſettle himſelf in the heart, and exerciſe his power, by inciting the perſon guilty to commit more wickedneſs. A furious angry perſon is the prey of Sathan: for this raging paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion having put out the eye of an angry perſons reaſon, Sathan makes him a fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for his own buſineſs: ſo that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed anger is a notable means that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than uſeth to work ſome perſons deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for when once rage hath blinded the eye of reaſon, he can eaſily lead a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into a gulph of all wickedneſs. O then, if thou doſt permit anger to rage in thy Spirit, if thou doſt nouriſh thy fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward humour, and art ſo often conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with thy Husband or with thy Wife, thou doſt gratifie thy ſelf exceedingly, thou doſt do as he would have thee, thou doſt give him a welcom entertainment in thy heart. Alas! how canſt thou fancy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:31630:47"/>ſuch a monſtrous Fiend. as to comply with his ſuggeſtions! Be not ſo vile a wretch, as to be kind to the mortal enemy of thy Soul. His deſign is to have thee angry, and ſo contentious, that he may hinder the exerciſe of thy reaſon, and ſo make thee unreaſonable in thy actions. O then, when thy anger begins to riſe, ſuppreſs it with this conſideration, <hi>If I give way to my anger, I pleaſe no one but the Devil, all others except the Devil are diſpleaſed with my anger and frowardneſs.</hi> That act muſt needs be dreadfully evil which the Devil doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the doing of. What a ſad wretch wilt thou evidence thy ſelf to be, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the counſel of God, and following the Devils!

Wilt thou ſhut the door of thy heart againſt God, and open it to let in Satan? Then thou makeſt thy ſelf a Child of the Devil, and not a Child of God; and in thy rage and fury doſt reſemble the Devil, <hi>who g es

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Perſons by their ſinful anger, their contentious wrangling and frowardneſs of ſpirit, do ſubject themſelves to the wrath of God, and bring his curſe upon them; yea, their anger brings upon them even in this life the dreadful effects of Gods anger. O thou angry Husband, or angry Wife! if thou doſt not repent thee of thy ſinful anger, frowardneſs, haſtineſs, and touchineſs of ſpirit upon every trivial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, God will deal with thee in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as thou would'ſt deal with thy Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or Wife in thy anger: for as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give others, ſo doth God forgive us. If therefore thou retain thine anger towards thine Husband, God will retain his anger towards thee. The Lord acteth the part of an Umpire, to make up breaches, heal differences, and make reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Relations; but if either of them be ſo ſtiff and contentious, that he or ſhe will not be reconciled, what doth that party elſe, but by froward behaviour and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate ſtiffneſs refuſing the Lords arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and determination, make God his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:31630:48"/>enemy? <hi>Eliphaz</hi> tells <hi>Job,</hi> cap. 5.2. <hi>Wrath killeth the fooliſh man:</hi> That may be taken two ways very true; the wrath of God kills or deſtroys the wrathful, raſh, and inconſiderate man, that hath no true go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of himſelf; for <hi>anger resteth in the boſom of fools, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.9. or the angry man kills himſelf; his own wrath is as a Knife to his throat, and as a Sword in his own bowels. Wrath properly is anger inveterate; Wrath is a long anger. When a man or woman is ſet upon it, when the Spirit is ſteeped or ſoaked in anger, then it is wrath: but in this place I conceive it notes a fervent heat, and diſtemper of Spirit preſently breaking forth, or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme vexation, fretting or diſquieting within, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.10. <hi>The wicked ſhall ſee it, and be grieved.</hi> That is, he ſhall have ſecret indignation in himſelf to ſee matters go ſo; he ſhall gnaſh with his teeth, and melt away. Gnaſhing of the teeth is cauſed by the vexing of the heart, and therefore ſaid <hi>he ſhall melt away,</hi> which notes an extreme heat within; ſo that a perſons wrath makes him or her melt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as we ſay of a perſon furiouſly vex'd, <hi>it melos his</hi> (or her) <hi>greaſe with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing.</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:31630:48"/>This is an effect of Divine diſpleaſure, whereby God in judgment doth ſuffer peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wrath to be ſo vexatious to them, that it makes their lives a continual death to them, and at laſt ſo weary and waſt their ſpirits, that they die for very grief; and except the Lord be merciful to them, and the death of Chriſt heal the wounds that their anger and impatiency have made, they will murder their own Souls; for ever frowardneſs and anger is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſin and torment. For <hi>People tare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their anger, Job</hi> 18.4. The more fretful people are, the more miſerable do they make themſelves. Thoſe that are of wrathful ſpirits will certainly feel ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the wrath of God either in this life, or in the life to come. That muſt needs be hurtful, yea mortal to men, that carries in it a reſiſtance to the immortal God. Some anger is not only grief for the oppoſition that perſons meet with, but a kind of ſtomacking at God who permits them to be oppoſed or croſſed, and tho' they do not confeſs it to be ſo, yet the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God knows it to be ſo.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:31630:49"/>
               <p>Now know that the wrath of man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt man is a ſin which God will puniſh with further wrath. God will powre out wrath upon wrathful perſons: and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the wrath of man ſtirs up God to puniſh man, if we obſerve what the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.15. <hi>If ye bite and devour one another.</hi> What is this <hi>biting</hi> and <hi>devouring?</hi> that is, every act which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that love which God commands us to exerciſe towards our Neighbour, or our near and dear Relation, is a <hi>biting</hi> and <hi>devouring.</hi> We <hi>bite</hi> and <hi>devour</hi> one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother when we are unkind, wrathful and vexatious one to another. See what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows as the effect of their paſſionate and froward carriages one to another. Take heed ye be not conſumed one of another. Take heed leſt by walking ſo unlike Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and ſo unanſwerable to the Law of Goſpel-love, you provoke God to kindle ſuch a fire among you, and in you, as may prove an utter conſumption. When Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Wives are not careful to walk together in love, as Chriſt hath loved us, God ſometimes (as an evidence of his wrath and diſpleaſure) gives them up to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:31630:49"/>a ſpirit of contention; and their breaches are like the Sea which cannot be healed. Their cruel and harſh dealings (which are yet but to the vexing and healing of one anothers ſpirits, or to devouring and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one anothers credit) may provoke ſuch Judgments as ſhall deſtroy their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Families and Eſtates, until nothing be left. Thus peoples peeviſh, froward and angry carriages to ſuch as are their neareſt Relations, provoke God to execute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges on them. When an Husband or Wife is fierce towards the other, God is angry with that perſon, and will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that perſon to live in peace, who hath ſo much love to diſſention; and this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon perſons, is both the fore-runner and demonſtration of further, yea, the final Judgment: And ſo ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.19. <hi>A man of great wrath ſhall ſuffer puniſhment.</hi> And Chriſt denounceth great Judgment againſt unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed anger, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. <hi>He that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his brother without cauſe, is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of judgment;</hi> intimating, that raſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is a capital offence, and doth bring a perſon under the ſevere ſentence of Gods Judgment. In the latter part of the verſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:31630:50"/>Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That if a perſons anger break out in diſreſpectful ſpeeches the ſin is the more capital,</hi> becauſe ſuch an one gives words of diſdain. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay to his brother,</hi> Racha, <hi>ſhall be in danger of the Councel:</hi> but if anger and diſdain proceed ſo far as to reproach a brother yet more deſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and call him <hi>Fool,</hi> then that perſon <hi>ſhall be in danger of Hell-fire. Conſider then, O Husband, or O Wife! the dreadful effects of thine anger, wrath, and frowardneſs. It ſubjects thee to the wrath of God, and Oh! what puniſhments, what conſuming judgments doth Gods wrath bring forth!</hi> The wrath of God may be ſpecificated into any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it produceth every evil. If Gods wrath be kindled but a little, if it be but as a ſpark, it will quickly grow up to a flame and conſume all, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.46. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> bids <hi>Aaron</hi> haſt to make the Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wrath is gone out from the Lord, the Plague is begun.</hi> But know, the wrath of God is not a paſſion in him, but an action towards man: He acts as men when they are angry, but he ſuffers nothing by his anger: He ſmites, and wounds, and pulls down, and deſtroys, like a wrathful man, yea, an enraged
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31630:50"/>man, yet he doth this in the exacteſt frame and ſweeteſt compoſure of his Spirit. But the wrath of God is only his holy and moſt bleſſed will burning with hatred againſt ſin, eſpecially the wrath and diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as the wrath of God draws out puniſhments, ſo thy angry, froward, pettiſh humours, draws out the wrath of God. The wrath of God is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and that muſt needs be a terrible evil that provokes God to powre it out.

O who can abide the coming of the Lord with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire!

That party that keeps in memory, and repeateth over old things that have been the occaſion of contention a long time before, is guilty of ſinful anger, is the promoter of new paſſions, and is the cauſe of the preſent diſcord; for ſuch a party doth deliberately endeavour to raiſe new ſtrife and contention: for as former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations ought to be forgiven, ſo they ought to be forgotten. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.9. <hi>He that covereth a tranſgreſſion, ſeeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter, ſeparateth very friends,</hi> even ſuch near Friends as Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife: And uſually that perſon that frequently repeateth former tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, hath a prejudice againſt the party
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:31630:52"/>of whom and to whom he or ſhe repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the matter, and by additions and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate perverſions aggravateth the things that are ſo repeated. So either the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or the Wife that makes a freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal of old matters, doth but increaſe his or her own fury, and fully evidence his or her own faultineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That party that doth in anger up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid the other with natural Infirmities, or with ſuch failings as he or ſhe was (through the power of temptation) overtaken in, by a ſurprize, and doth it in a vexatious way to caſt a ſlur or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace upon the other, is chiefly faulty in raiſing diſcord between them, and is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſinful anger, being the duty of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife to forbear every thing that may cauſe any breaches between them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Wife that doth divulge her Husbands miſcarriages to any third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and talk in company what evil he hath done, is really and principally the kindler of her own cauſeleſs anger, and the only occaſion of diſcord between her
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:31630:53"/>and her Husband; for that Husband that doth manifeſt anger againſt his Wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, or that Wife that is diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her fiery diſguſt of ſpirit againſt her Husband when others are preſent, that ſhe cares not at what time ſhe vents her ſelf, though it be at ſuch a time that ſhe is like to do no good with it. <hi>This thy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They twain being but one fleſh, the <hi>diſhonour of one</hi> is the <hi>diſgrace of the other.</hi> Love will cover a multitude of faults, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:31630:53"/>them, and ſpeak more than is truth, and this is the effect of that perſons ſinful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and diſpleaſure againſt the other. Many a man hath been put to it to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf in a publick way, to clear his good name from the ſlanders of a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and paſſionate Wife. An open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is not capable of doing ſo much wrong to him, as ſhe that is in his boſom, becauſe ſhe is eaſily to be believed, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed to know him better than any other: therefore that Wife that is not tender of the Reputation of her Husband, but in her anger will ſpeak things before others that tends to his diſgrace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is certainly guilty of ſinful anger, and the cauſe of all the diſcord that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
               <p>But perhaps ſhe will ſay, <hi>My Husband hath ſpoken words to others in his anger, that tended to my diſparagement; and why may not I ſpeak words to others that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to him?</hi>

               <p>In anſwer to this, <hi>Know, that the ſin of thy Husband cannot juſtifie thine own ſin, neither is that a good Argument to juſtifie thy offending God, becauſe thy Husband of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God likewiſe. It may be thy Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in his haſt did once unadviſedly ſpeak ſomething to thy diſhonour, but thou mak'ſt it a frequent practice upon every ſlight occaſion of thy diſguſt: Thy Husband may have deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſuch a practice, but thou continueſt it; and in excuſe of the continuance of thy ſinful practice in reproaching thy Husband, thou doſt upbraid him with that ſingle act of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſomething that was not honourable to thee, which perhaps by thy untoward carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thou might'ſt give him great provocations to do.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:31630:55"/>notice of, that are not at all offenſive to God, but only not correſpondent to his or her corrupt and imperious will. That party that doth this, is the ſole cauſe of all contentions that do ariſe between them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That party is guilty of ſinful anger, that when contentions do ariſe at any time between Husband and Wife, that doth firſt of all give railing, reviling, filthy, and reproachful language; for no perſons anger can be lawful and holy, that doth not obſerve Chriſtian modeſty in abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from malicious and wicked ſpeeches, and unjuſt and ſpightful actions, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his or her anger; for ſuch as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie themſelves with ſpightful and bitter ſpeeches, are not at all guided by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. It is uſual when an Husband or Wife is cauſeleſly angry, and cannot convince the other of any particular of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt God, to rail at the other for ſome contempt that he or ſhe apprehends to have received from the other.

               <p n="7">7. That party that doth moſt juſtifie his or her anger, that like <hi>Jonah</hi> ſaith, <hi>I do well to be angry,</hi> and will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the evil of his or her anger, but will make vain and frivolous pretences to excuſe it, is principally guilty of ſinful anger, and is principal cauſer of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that happens between them, as Husband and Wife.</p>

For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a perſon hath done that indiſpoſeth him or her, or maketh him or her averſe to the ſervice of God, is ſinful.

When vain trifles have ſtirred up an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or Wife to wrath, his or her perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in it, doth evidence that it did ſeem to begin without a cauſe; and ſo againſt all reaſon the injuſtice of his or her anger makes him or her to perſiſt in it with the greater obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; and therefore thou doſt retain it, yea encreaſe it, becauſe thou may'ſt not ſeem to others to be angry without a cauſe, and that the greatneſs of thine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

               <p n="1">1. ENdeavour in the way of God the mortification of that prevailing principle of fleſh that is in thee, if thou would'ſt be reſtrained from thy violent paſſions. So long as the fleſh is deeply rooted in thee, it will bring forth its fruits; and anger, wrath, malice and contention are the fruits of the fleſh. If thou would'ſt not have ſuch ill fruits come forth from thy fleſh, endeavour always to deſtroy the root of thy corruptions; for the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker thy fleſhly principle is, the ſeldomer wilt thou be moved to anger. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of in-dwelling ſin remaining in our mortal bodies, that it may not have life and power to bring forth the deeds and works of the fleſh, is the conſtant duty of believers. In-dwelling ſin is the ſame which I mean by a fleſhly principle. Now the more powerful thy corruptions are,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:31630:58"/>the more violent will thy paſſions be, which are the off-ſpring of thy in-bred corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Thou canſt not (while in the body) utterly deſtroy in-dwelling ſin, that it ſhould have no more hold at all, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in thy heart; but this thou muſt aim at, and earneſtly deſire: thou muſt with thy heart really deſire that in-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſin ſhould leave neither root or fruit in thy heart or life. Therefore the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication that I preſs thee to ſet upon, is an habitual weakening of in-dwelling ſin, that thou may'ſt not be ſo much under the power of a ſtrong bent and inclination unto ſin, that it may not have ſuch life, power, vigour, promptneſs and readineſs to be ſtirring. This mortification that I here intend, is a daily endeavour after the weakening and aboliſhing of in-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſin by little and little, that it might not incline thee &amp; imploy thee with ſuch efficacy to make thee a ſervant to it, as heretofore. If thou let the root of thy corruption abide in ſtrength and vigour, it will be ſtill bringing forth new fruits of the fleſh, and thou wilt be hurried into violent paſſions upon every ſlight occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Ane if we ſee perſons raging in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:31630:59"/>wrath and fury, we may conclude that in-dwelling ſin is in its full power and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in them.</p>
               <p>Now, thou canſt not carry on this work of Mortification, except thou art ingrafted into Chriſt by Faith. I do not ſay, Except thou art aſſured of it, but <hi>Thou muſt be indeed a true believer,</hi> becauſe mortification is not done without the aid of Gods Spirit, who is promiſed to do it, and all other means are vain without him. Now the Spirits aid for the work of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not gained except we are in Chriſt by Faith, and when we are in Chriſt we have the Spirit, and ſo have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer for mortification. All attempts then for mortification of in-dwelling ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an intereſt in Chriſt, are vain; for there muſt be firſt Converſion and Faith in Chriſt, then mortification will enſue. Know then, that ſin cannot be killed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an intereſt in the death of Chriſt, or mortified without the Spirit. Thou then being a believer, make daily and ſincere oppoſition of in-dwelling ſin; riſe then mightily againſt the firſt movings and acting of thy corruption, againſt its firſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:31630:59"/>conceptions; let it not have allowance from thee for one ſtep, for it is impoſſible to fix bounds to it. If thou findeſt thy corruption to begin to entangle thy thoughts, riſe up with all thy ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, with no leſs indignation than if it had fully accompliſhed what it aimed at, elſe it will get ground in the affections to delight in it; and if thou findeſt it too powerful an enemy for thee, ſet Faith on work in Chriſt for the killing of thy ſin. His blood is the great ſovereign remedy for ſin-ſick Souls. Fill thy Soul with the due conſideration of that proviſion which is laid up in Chriſt for this end, that thy corruptions may be mortified. Behold the Lord Chriſt that hath all fulneſs of Grace in his heart, all fulneſs of Power in his hand: He is able to ſlay all thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, there is proviſion enough in him for thy relief and aſſiſtance. Then raiſe up thy heart by faith to an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of relief from Chriſt, and thy Soul ſhall be ſatisfied with the relief it expects, he will aſſuredly deliver thee, he will ſlay thy corruptions. Mortification of ſin is one peculiar end of the death of Chriſt, which ſhall aſſuredly be accompliſhed by
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31630:60"/>it. And this whole work that I am preſſing thee to endeavour after, is effected, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, and accompliſhed by the power of the Spirit in all the parts and degrees of it; and that thou may'ſt have more power to oppoſe and weaken the power of thy corruptions, beg of God earneſtly for Chriſts ſake to give thee his Spirit. O then, is it from the corruption in thy heart that thy paſſions break out againſt thy Husband or againſt thy Wife in thy life? Is it thy corruption that makes thee froward and contentious, that makes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord between thee and thy Husband? Then bend all thy ſtrength againſt thy corruptions, by the aid of the Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the <hi>mortification of the deeds of the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 8.13. Before the ſtrength of thy corruption is weakened, thy anger and frowardneſs will not be prevented; for as the motions of original ſin are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, thou wilt not be rid of the <hi>body of Death,</hi> until the death of thy body; ſo they are exceeding violent and impetuous in their operations, and puts people into violent paſſions upon ſmall occaſions. If thou doſt not oppoſe thy corruptions, thou doſt not endeavour to prevent ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:31630:60"/>breaking out into furiouſneſs of Spirit. Keep down then thy in-dwelling ſin, and thou wilt not have ſuch hot conteſts with thy Husband or with thy Wife, for <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling and contention come from the Luſts that are within, James</hi> 4 1. Conſider then when ever any thing diſpleaſeth thee, <hi>If I be angry, I gratifie my corruptions, which I am bound to mortifie, Col.</hi> 3.5. Certainly thy froward carriages to thy Husband do ariſe more from the evil that is within thee than the diſpleaſure that is done thee. Thou haſt juſt cauſe to ſay, <hi>It is not my temptation, but my corruption, that makes me froward;</hi> and ſo do thou fall a ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mortifie thy corruptions if ever thou wilt prevent thy paſſions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, O Husband, and O Wife! if you will prevent fallings out with one another, keep up your conjugal love in a conſtant heat and vigour. Love will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs wrath, as well as prevent it, you cannot have a bitter mind upon ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations againſt thoſe that you dearly love, much leſs can you proceed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling words, or to averſeneſs and eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedneſs, or any abuſe of one another; or
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:31630:61"/>or if a breach or wound be unhappily made, the balſamick quality of Love will heal it; but when Love once cooleth, ſmall matters will exaſperate and breed diſtaſt: Therefore I ſhall give ſome dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions how conjugal love may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and preſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take more notice of the good that is in one another, than the evil. Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> not the obſervation of one anothers faults make you over-look or forget one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Virtues. Love is kindled and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the ſight of Love and Goodneſs. If you will obſerve nothing in one another but your infirmities, and ſome indiſcreet, inconſiderate, and unadviſed actings: You neither preſerve Love, nor keep Peace with one another. If you will magnifie faults in one another, and flight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe any good qualities, you take the readieſt courſe to deſtroy conjugal love, and beget hatred to one another: therefore turn away your eyes from one anothers humane frailties, and prize what you can ſee of God in one another, and put a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable conſtruction upon words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and this is an excellent way to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh conjugal love, and prevent diſſentions between you.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:31630:61"/>
               <p n="2">2. Stir up that moſt in one another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to exerciſes which is beſt, and ſtir not up that which is worſt. Avoid that which will move your corruptions to violent opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; uſe ſuch actions as may provoke one another unto love and good works, and then the good that is in you will moſt appear, and the evil will be as buried. There is ſome uncleanneſs in the beſt on Earth, and if you will be daily ſtirring the filth, no wonder if you have the annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and for that you may thank your ſelves. Draw out the fragrancy of that which is good and delectable in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and do not by your imprudence or peeviſhneſs ſtir up the worſt, and then you will find that the moſt faulty of you will appear more amiable to you, and then conjugal love will be increaſed, and ſtrife prevented.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Make not one another froward by froward carriages one to another: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have your ſelves to one another in all gentleneſs and mildneſs of Spirit. A mild Chriſtian is an healing perſon, who is skilful to cure the Diſeaſes of the mind,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31630:62"/>and very inſtrumental to preſerve love and unity. A mild Chriſtian is loving in all carriages, and Love will cauſe Love as Fire kindleth Fire; and the ſtronger your love is to one another, the better agreement there will be one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Take much delight in the love, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and converſe of each other, this is the way to perpetuate conjugal love to each other; there is nothing that a perſons heart is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately ſet upon as delight, yet the lawful delight allowed them by God they can turn into diſdain: the delight that would entangle perſons in ſin, and turn them from their duty, and from God, is that which is forbidden them, but this is a delight that is helpful to you in your duty, and wou'd keep you from ſin. When Husband and Wife take pleaſure in one another, it uniteth them in duty, and helpeth them with eaſe to do the work that relates to each other, and bear their burdens. Avoid therefore all things that may repreſent you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant and unlovely to each other, and uſe all lawful means to cheriſh complacency and delight. All unſeemly carriage &amp; fooliſh ſpeech which favour of contempt muſt be ſhunned, as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31630:62"/>temptations which would hinder you from that love, pleaſure and content which Husband and Wife ſhould have in one another.</hi> This is the way to preſerve conjugal love, and reſtrain from anger.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>To preſerve conjugal love between each other, be faithful in rendring all due conjugal reſpects to each other, that the ends of lawful marriage may not be neglected: The neglect of thoſe duties, as it is a ſin forbidden of God, ſo it breeds a contempt of each other, as it may be a means of provoking one another to ſin, ſo it doth abundantly destroy love to each other. Read what the Apoſtle ſaith in</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23. 4, 5. It is good for a man not to touch a woman; nevertheleſs, to avoid fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let every man have his own Wife, and every Woman her own Husband. Let the Husband render unto the Wife due bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, and likewiſe alſo the Wife unto the Husband. The Wife hath not power over her own body, but the Husband: likewiſe alſo the Husband hath not power over his own body, but the Wife. <hi>Defraud you not one another, except it be with conſent for a time, that ye may give your ſelves to Faſting and Prayer, and come together again,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:31630:63"/>that Sathan tempt you not for your incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> Therefore thoſe perſons live contrary to the nature of their Relation, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from one another in this reſpect: and a faithful diſcharge of theſe conjugal duties, doth very much eſtabliſh love to each other, and very much prevent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and diſcord.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Beware you do not neglect the worſhip of God in your families, for if in your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies you give not God ſo much ſervice as he requires, he will permit you to withdraw re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects from each other; and this God will do, becauſe you neglect to pay the reſpects that you owe to him. Faithfulneſs and delight in Gods ſervice is the way to make you faithful to, and to delight in each other.

Do not let your frowardneſs, cauſed by a defect of love to each other, deſtroy your calmneſs and ſerenity of ſpirit for a trifle. Where conjugal love is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, the Husband and Wife never knew what the ſweetneſs of a quiet, meek and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpirit meant. O then! keep warm your conjugal love, that will make you prize a quiet ſpirit at an high rate, and be willing to ſuffer much for it, and follow after it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſo much good in it.

If you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the excellency of this grace, you would be fond of no other excellency, you would not think better of your ſelves than others, you would not boaſt of what you have, but be humbled for what you want.

Indeed thy wantings being a great deal more than thy aboundings, and thy imperfections
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:31630:71"/>more than thy perfections, ſhould be to thee a greater matter of humbling, than thy abounding or perfection can be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Pride. Conſider the deficiencies in thy ſelf, how low thou art in knowledg, how low in grace, how much thou art behind others, how much thou art below what thou might'ſt be; and have attained to, both in the light of Knowledge, and in the ſtrength of Grace, and this will migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily humble thee; then conſider how much thou comeſt ſhort of what others have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; as it is an excellent means to keep thy Soul from murmuring and diſcontent, to conſider how many are below thee in the enjoyments of the comforts of this life, ſo it is an excellent means to keep thee from pride to conſider how many others are above thee in ſpiritual endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo far above thee, as thy knowledge is but ignorance compared with their knowledge, thy ſtrength weakneſs, thy faith unbelief, thy patience unquietneſs of ſpirit, thy very fruitfulneſs barrenneſs compared with theirs. Such conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are mighty humbling conſiderations. Again, conſider and reflect upon thine own ſinfulneſs. Thy defects in good may keep thy heart low, but thy abundance

Didſt thou know thine own ignorance and miſunderſtandings, didſt thou know all thoſe abominations that are in thy heart, what earthly-mindedneſs, what inordinate Creature-love, what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, what envy lie there; didſt thou know how deceitful and falſe thy heart is towards God, thy ſelf, and others, ſuch knowledge would make thee ſtrike ſail, and come lower, and make thee abhor thy ſelf exceedingly: Diſt thou once know thy ſelf aright, what a frail, blind,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:31630:72"/>and ſinful Creature thou art, how humble and heavenly would'ſt thou be! Didſt thou rightly know that thou art a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it would cauſe thee to live more like a new Creature. Didſt thou remember that thou art but a Creature, the work of Gods hand, this would keep thee low and humble; but didſt thou know what a ſinful polluted Creature thou art, thou would'ſt ſoon come not only to a lower eſtimate, but an utter abhorrency of thy ſelf. Thou doſt over-think thy ſelf, becauſe thou doſt not know thy ſelf: Thou doſt over-rate thy ſelf, becauſe thou doſt not rightly underſtand thy ſelf. O then, endeavour to underſtand thy ſelf better; and endeavour to make uſe of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations that I have here hinted. This is the way to make thee ſenſible of thine own nothingneſs: This is the way to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thy pride, and keep thee humble; and if thou wert more humble, thou would'ſt be more peaceable with thy Wife or Husband.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be much in the meditation of Chriſts humbling and abaſing himſelf for thee. What can kill pride, if the humblings of Chriſt do not? How may'ſt thou ſchool
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:31630:73"/>and chaſtiſe thy proud Soul with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſt in his abaſements! <hi>What! was Chriſt an humble Chriſt, and ſhall I be a proud Chriſtian? was he an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Maſter, and ſhall I be a proud Diſciple? Did Chriſt empty himſelf, and make himſelf of no Reputation, and ſhall I, that am but emptineſs, be lifted up with a Reputation of my ſelf, or with a Reputation that others have of me? Did Chriſt abuſe himſelf to the form of a Servant, and ſhall I lift up my ſelf as if I did reign as a King? Chriſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf, and became obedient to death, even the death of the Croſs, and what have I to glory in but the Croſs of Chriſt? Gal.</hi> 6.14. O then, if thou haſt any thing to be proud of, 'tis the Croſs of Chriſt. Think then often and much of the humblings of Chriſt, and then thou wilt think of thy ſelf as a meer nothing: This is the moſt effectual means through the Spirit to bring down the ſwellings of thy heart, and to make thee truly humble. And thus I have ended what I have to ſay in directing thee how to get thy pride mortified and thy ſpirit humbled. O then, if thou would'ſt be reſtrained from ſinful anger, and if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou would'ſt have any quiet in thine
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31630:73"/>own ſpirit, and carry it peaceably and quietly to thy Husband or to thy Wife, endeavour to be of a more lowly ſpirit, and to be cloathed with humility. As long as thou doſt nouriſh thy proud humour, thou wilt fall out with thy neareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for every trifle, but a lowly ſpirit doth its utmoſt to preſerve peace and unity. Such a one is ſo tender of others, as that he or ſhe is not willing to grieve any one in the world, much leſs an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or a Wife. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife and vain-glory, but in lowlineſs of mind let each eſteem others better than themſelves.</hi> The luſt of vain-glory, whereby a perſon endeavours more to gain eſteem from men, than to honour God, is the mother of contention and ſtrife, and a great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to union and peace; and here the Apoſtle preſcribeth <hi>humility</hi> as an Antidote againſt ſtrife and contention, and a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign mean for attaining unto and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of union and peace. But where pride is predominant, men and women walk ſo, as that they care not to give content to any body but themſelves in the Family; they muſt have all the content,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:31630:74"/>and no body elſe be pleaſed. Certainly an humble Spirit is much freer from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry paſſions than any other, becauſe as an humble perſon is not willing to give offence to any, ſo is not ready to take offence from others: for it is pride of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be ready to take offence from others upon every trifle, and by this means per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons prove to be very burdenſom to others. The ground of a proud perſons taking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is this, becauſe they think that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body muſt ſay as they ſay, and do as they do, elſe they cry out that they are always oppoſed, and becauſe they think their own judgments beſt, and ſuch a thing is better, therefore others muſt do it, and if they do not, then they are lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then they are proud and ſtout, and break out into unſeemly ſpeeches, be inflamed with paſſion, evidencing that they are under the tyranny of their pride.

O then, if thou wilt evidence thy ſelf to be a Child of God, muſt thou not labour to expreſs his Virtues?

O what little cauſe haſt thou then to manifeſt a furious ſpirit againſt thy Husband or thy Wife for every trifle, ſeeing God doth not deal furiouſly with thee for great offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces!

And thy only obſerving of the perſon that doth in any way diſpleaſe thee, and not conſidering that God hath an hand in all things that befall thee, is the cauſe that thou art ſo often tranſported with furious paſſions. An obſervation that God hath an hand in all things that befall thee, is as water to quench the inflamation of thy angry paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

For, 1. <hi>If thou doſt look to the hand of God in thoſe things that diſtaſt thee, it will conſtrain thee to confeſs that all thy chaſtiſements are juſt, far leſs than thy ſins have deſerved; for indeed all the oppoſition that thou haſt from thy Husband or thy Wife, is in ſome meaſure a rebuke of God againſt ſome miſcarriage of thine. And God in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thee to be exerciſed with ſuch things as do very much diſtaſt thy ſpirit, doth do

For indeed ſuch croſſes and provocations as thou doſt meet with from thy Husband or thy Wife, are but light to a gracious heart; and if not ſo light to thee as to others, yet but momentory: but thy ſins have deſerved infinite and eternal puniſhments. If therefore the Lord uſe thoſe earthly rods to correct thy ſins, thou ſhould'ſt rather admire his mercy, than be angry at ſo gentle chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If thou didſt but conſider, that the hand of God is in every thing whereby thy Husband or thy Wife diſpleaſeth thee, thou would'ſt ſee that the manner of the Lords dealing with thee is tender and compaſſionate.</hi> Pſal. 25.10. All the ways of the Lord are Mercy and Truth, to them that fear him, and keep his Teſtimonies. <hi>When thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveſt to be cut down root and branch, and caſt into unquenchable fire, he doth only lop and prune thee, to make thee more fruitful: Therefore, if the matter be well weighted, thou haſt more cauſe to be thankful, than to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Conſider with thy ſelf, when any word is ſpoken, or any act done, by thy Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or by thy Wife, that hath a tendency to diſcompoſe thee, and ſay,</hi> It is the will of God to afflict me in my Wife, or in my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:

Humiliation for that which is paſt, will be a ſpecial help to keep thee from barking, ſnarling at, and biting thy Husband or thy Wife. I uſe ſuch expreſſions, becauſe angry perſons are very dogged in their carriages one to another.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If thou would'ſt live in peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs with thy Husband or thy Wife, thou ſhould'ſt be offended with nothing in thy Husband or in thy Wife, but what God is offended with. Such of thy Husbands acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as do diſpleaſe God, ſhould diſpleaſe thee. What authority or right haſt thou to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:31630:81"/>be offended with thy Husband, when God is not? or what reaſon canſt give why thou ſhould'ſt be diſtaſted with any of his actions that God is not? Yea, certainly thou ought'ſt not to find fault with that in thy Husband, which God doth not. If you would both of you more faithfully endeavour to conform to Gods will, your wills would be more united, and there would not be ſuch differences between you. But if your wills do oppoſe Gods will, 'tis no wonder if there be heats and conteſts between you. Sin is the greateſt make-bate in the world: if you are not affraid of diſpleaſing God, you will not be affraid of diſpleaſing one another. <hi>O then, if thou could'ſt ſo far govern thine own ſpirit as to take offence at nothing in thy Husband but what is ſinful, thou would'ſt not be ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him as thou art. The Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> Epheſ. 4.26. Be angry, and ſin not: <hi>or, be angry with nothing, or for nothing, but what is ſinful; for I find the learned Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters rendring the meaning thus:</hi> Be not angry with the Perſon of one another, but his Sin, and be angry as much againſt that ſin in thy ſelf, as another. <hi>Obſerve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> but this rule, and it will prevent abundance of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:31630:82"/>contention that uſually ariſeth between ſuch near Relations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. If thou would'ſt prevent the raging of thine anger againſt thy Husband or thy Wife, take heed of the firſt beginnings of thy paſſion. We know when a fire is begun in an houſe, we do not ſtay quenching of it, till the houſe be all on h flame; but if there be but a little fire kindled in any part of the houſe, if it be but a ſmoke, thou wilt ſay where is it, and thou art not quiet till thou haſt found it out: ſo it ſhould be when paſſions begin to riſe, thy Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be on fire, and thou ſhould'ſt be as much for quenching it at firſt riſing, as thou would'ſt when thou ſeeſt fire break out in thine houſe at the very firſt. Perhaps a Diſh of water may quench that now, that if thou ſtay'ſt till half an hour hence, it may take hold of ſuch ſolid matter, as that it paſſeth all thy labour and induſtry to quench, and makes a pitiful ruine. So if thou obſerveſt thy choler from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſeeing it begin to fume or kindle for ſome light or ſmall offence, it is eaſie for thee to ſuppreſs it, and ſtay the courſe; but if it be once ſettled, and begin to ſwell, and thou ſtir it up, and inflame it, it will
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:31630:82"/>be hard for thee afterwards to quench it. A ſmall ſpark, if nouriſhed, will increaſe to a furious flame; ſo there have been moſt fearful diſtempers of paſſion from ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall beginnings, which have broken out into moſt fearful outrages. How often is it in a Family, that a little ſpark doth kindle a great fire. At firſt there may be but a word ſpoken amiſs, that might eaſily have been paſt over; but that word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets another, and another, and ſo grows to a moſt hideous flame. Sometimes it is between the neareſt Relations, as Husband and Wife, that a contention doth ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them for a very ſmall matter, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the very geſture of the hand, or ſome ſpots on the apparel. Oh! a very ſlight ground for diſtaſt, and it argues ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little or no Grace in that heart that is diſpleaſed with ſuch inconſiderable things with which God is not diſpleaſed at all. Sometimes it begins in the very counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: the Wife thinks that her Husband looks not upon her with ſo pleaſant a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance as he was wont to do, and from thence ſhe begins to have ſurmizes and ſuſpicions, and then comes to make miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations, and from thence there
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:31630:83"/>comes a ſtrangeneſs, and from being ſtrange ſhe begins to hearken to tales that are carried to her againſt her Husband, and to believe them, and to aggravate them: Then ſhe begins to ſpeak ſome hard words againſt him, and then to do him ſome ill offices, then break out into violent and eminent paſſions and actings againſt him, reviling him, caſting falſe aſperſions upon him, endeavouring to repreſent him to others as the vileſt wretch living, laying ſuch things to his charge as he is altogether innocent of, and then to deny all conjugal reſpects to him, and then wiſh ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been related to him; and ſome go ſo far, as to uſe indirect means to extinguiſh the Relation. Others grow fond of other men, and ſo come to have unlawful inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with them: whereas had there been care taken by her at the beginning, all this might have been prevented, as the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.14. <hi>The beginning of ſtrife is as one letteth out water; therefore leave off contention before it be meddled with:</hi> or before the breach be made ſo great as not to be repaired. So then when thy heart is firſt ſet on fire with anger, do thou preſently endeavour to quench it
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:31630:83"/>with the water of the Spirit; for after thou art throughly inflamed, it will be too late to apply any remedy till the flame hath ſpent it ſelf. But thou may'ſt ſay, <hi>I fall into anger many times when I never meant it, and it hath overcome me before I am aware: how therefore ſhould I prevent that which I did not fore-ſee, or free my ſelf from it when it violently over-ruleth me?</hi> To which I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If thou doſt carefully watch over thy ſelf, thou ſhalt eaſily perceive when thou art inclining to anger; for there are many ſigns which go before a ſtorm, and many ſymptoms which diſcover Diſeaſes before perſons do fall into them: So thou may'ſt eaſily diſcern in thy ſelf many notes and ſigns of this furious and tempeſtuous ſtorm, and raging feaver of mind, unjuſt anger, before it break forth and ſhew it ſelf. Much pain, ſwelling of heart, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and bitterneſs of ſpirit appear before it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Anger doth not preſently, as ſoon as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into thy heart, over-rule thee, before (by increaſe of fuel) it be grown to a greater height than it had at firſt. The moſt furious anger attaineth not its full ſtrength at firſt entrance, but by little and little increaſeth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:31630:84"/>like a flame, by taking hold of new matter; and the fire in the beginning thereof is eaſily ſuppreſſed:</hi> Firſt, <hi>by not yielding obedience to an angry paſſion, nor bolieving her in any thing that ſhe ſaith or doth, to prompt thee to furious actions. Therefore if thou obſerveſt thy ſelf like to be tranſported with choler, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to retain thy ſelf, and ſtrive to moderate thy paſſions, and divert the infirmity that ſeeks to ſeize upon thee: give no ear to any incitements unto anger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If thou would'ſt timely ſubdue thy anger, withdraw the food wherewith it is nouriſhed. The moſt furious anger will ſoon be mitigated, if it be not continually nouriſhed with a new ſupply of matter: the fuel of anger is the multiplying of words. As nothing ſooner than the wind cauſeth a ſmall ſpark to burſt out into a furious flame. ſo nothing ſooner doth cauſe a ſmall ſpark of anger to increaſe into a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous raging flame, than the wind of words. Do not then think to diſgorge thy ſtomach of anger by vomiting out ſpleen in bitter words, for they only aggravate things for the continuing of anger. Do thou therefore uſe moſt modeſty. Mildneſs of ſpeech and lowneſs of voice doth ſo withdraw nouriſhment from the fire of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that it will ſoon of it ſelf be extinguiſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:31630:84"/>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>If thine anger begin to ariſe, make ſome delay before thou ſpeakeſt or doſt any thing. Give not place to wrath, let it not have vent by ſudden or unadviſed words. Anger ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red will languiſh, but let out will flame into further miſchief. 'Tis ſome cure of paſſion to delay it; therefore</hi> Solomon <hi>ſaith,</hi> Prov. 19.11. The diſcretion of a man deferreth his anger, <hi>and it is wiſdom ſo to do; ſo 'tis thine honour, it's</hi> the glory of a man to paſs by a tranſgreſſion, <hi>not to take diſtaſt at every of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Therefore 'tis good to check thy precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant motions by delay, and due recourſe to reaſon, leſt by following thy paſſion too cloſe, thou run thy ſelf into great inconveniencies. O by thy quickneſs and ſhortneſs of Spirit thou art tranſported into many indecencies, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God, and wound thy conſcience: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do what thou canſt to ſuppreſs thine anger as ſoon as it doth appear.</hi> If this courſe were taken by Husbands and Wives, it would be an excellent means to prevent and ſuppreſs anger and diſcord between them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If thou would'ſt not be angry with thy Husband or thy Wife, take heed of too much curioſity in obſerving every little thing or every trifle in thy Husbands
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31630:85"/>or Wifes words or actions: If thou would'ſt not be angry, thou muſt paſt over a great many things and take no notice of them; thou muſt have a kind of holy negligence of a great many things, and paſs over, and ſee and not ſee, and turn away thine ears from many things; as in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Alſo take no heed unto all words that are ſpoken.</hi> Many things that are ſpoken thou muſt let paſs unregarded, many times hard ſayings, or ill ſpeeches, vain and undervaluing ſpeeches, ſpeeches ſpoken at random without occaſion, without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and without any real detriment to us, muſt not be taken notice of, to make them occaſions of enmity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or to break our own peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. Thus Mr. <hi>Cotten</hi> on this wiſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſay, do not take notice of hard or ſlight ſpeeches ſpoken againſt thy ſelf, or vain impertinent words that do thee no perſonal prejudice. <hi>Paul</hi> took little notice of words ſpoken againſt him. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. <hi>But with me it is a very ſmall thing that I ſhould be judged of you.</hi> Never keep empty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent words in thy memory, for thy memory is not to be filled with traſh, and all occaſions of enmity and diſcord ſhould
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:31630:85"/>be put out of thy mind; as in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.18. When things done by thy Husband or Wife are not of any conſequence, rather let him or her know that thou doſt not take notice of them. But if thou wilt be taking notice of, or offended with every thing that is done or ſpoken, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but there will be a great deal of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance between thy ſelf and Husband.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If thou haſt an angry Husband or an angry Wife, and yet after all the means thou haſt uſed to prevent his or her angry paſſions; yet if he or ſhe remain froward and contentious upon every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle, then obſerve this rule, That thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to walk before thy Husband or thy Wife in a convincing way. Thy Wife is of a troubleſom Spirit, and wreſts every word that thou ſpeakeſt, and gives thee railing and reviling ſpeeches; thou canſt not in any way meddle with her, but thou doſt foul thy fingers: yet reſolve with thy ſelf that thou wilt not render her reviling for reviling; and though ſhe be froward, yet thou wilt not deal frowardly with her. Say within thy ſelf, <hi>I will do what I can to convince her in a conſtant way of Good, of Holineſs, Juſtice and Righteouſneſs; it may
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:31630:86"/>be I may melt her heart that way: I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved whatever evil ſhe doth to me, I will do good to her.</hi> Here is a peaceable Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and this is the way to keep peace between thy ſelf and Wife. When means have been tried to quiet her Spirit, yet it cannot be done; yet walk convincingly before her, and a convincing converſation in a few months may prevail with her heart more than all the means that thou haſt uſed. Take but this courſe, and thou wilt find in ſome time that the bitterneſs of her Spirit will be allayed. O then wait on the Lord, keep his way, walk ſtrictly and inoffenſively, and commit thy cauſe to God, and in time all the ſtirs and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of thy Wife will vaniſh away, and come to nothing, and ſhe will be at laſt convinced, and ſay that thou art a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant of God.</p>
               <p n="13">13. If thou would'ſt live in peace with thy Husband or thy Wife, be much in ſecret prayer, earneſtly importuning God that he would mortifie thy angry paſſions. Prayer is an excellent ſpiritual help to prevent frowardneſs and diſcord between Husband and Wife. Thou may'ſt cry out of the contentions that are between thy
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:31630:86"/>ſelf and Husband, of the bitterneſs of his Spirit, and that he is an offence to thee: but I appeal this day in the name of God to thy conſcience, what time haſt thou ſpent in ſecret prayer to make thy moan to God, to complain to God in ſecret be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and thy Soul? Perhaps when thou art in more publick Prayer, thou may'ſt pray God to heal the breaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thee and thy Husband, or thy Wife: but when thou haſt been in ſecret, haſt thou powred out thy heart with earneſt prayer, that God would find out means of reconciliation. Say unto the Lord. <hi>There is a great diſtance between my ſelf and Wife, or between my ſelf and Husband, and I find all means that I uſe ineffectual to make up the breaches between us: But, Lord, thou knoweſt how to ſtill the rage of my Wifes ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thou knoweſt how to compoſe differences between us. Do it, Lord, I humbly pray thee. Oh I pray thee, O gracious God, to vouchſafe the aſſiſtance of thy Spirit to ſubdue mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or my Wifes anger, that both our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be ſo ruled and ſanctified, that they being freed from natural corruption, may be made fit and ſerviceable for the ſetting forth of thy glory, and the mutual good, peace and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:31630:87"/>comfort of each other, and the furthering one anothers Salvation.</hi> This is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means to prevent frowardneſs and contention between Husband and Wife; for it is only the water of the Spirit, and the Shield of Faith, which is able to quench the fury of our paſſions, of which Prayer is the chief means of obtaining, and then we ſhall find that what cannot be done at all by our ſtrength and skill, may be eaſily done by Gods aſſiſtance and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Thus, O Husband, and O Wife, I have given ſeveral directions how you may prevent anger and diſcord between each other: And O that the Lord would give you hearts to follow them. And therefore let me give you ſome arguments to preſs you to uſe thoſe helps and directions for the reſtraining and ſuppreſſing your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry paſſions; and that very briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thou ſhould'ſt take care to uſe means to ſuppreſs and prevent thy angry paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe the furiouſneſs and diſquiet of a perſons ſpirit hinders that perſon from Communion with God; it keeps him or her from intimacy with, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:31630:87"/>enjoyments of God. As God forbids men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.24. <hi>to make any friendſhip with an angry perſon, neither to go with a furious man, leſt they learn his ways, and receive deſtruction to their Souls.</hi> That is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the company of thoſe who are angry and cholerick, leſt by a certain contagion they poyſon thee with their paſſions. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo will God withdraw from ſuch as he commands us to withdraw from, and ſhould'ſt thou not watch againſt evil, that will make thee to be without God in the world? 'Tis ſad indeed to do any thing to cauſe the withdrawments of God; for as ſoon as God departs from a Soul, the Devil viſits it: therefore it is ſaid, <hi>That a giving way to wrath, is a giving place to the Devil.</hi> Oh what a miſerable exchange is this! and what a ſad loſs is it to loſe God! and when God is driven away by the exceſs of angry paſſions, there is a loſs of that ſweet and holy diſpoſition of Soul which ought to be in every Chriſtian, and is in every one that walketh in peace and fellowſhip with God, in true peace of conſcience. As there is required reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with God, and a ſenſe of his love, ſo likewiſe a freedom from the hurry of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31630:88"/>boiſterous paſſions, and a calmneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is a neceſſary qualification in the ſubject capable to hold Communion with God, and receive the beams of his favour. O conſider this ſeriouſly, Doſt thou think it nothing to be without the bleſſing of God? Alas! then thou loſeſt Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and guidance in times of danger, who then ſhall help thee in thy ſtreights, or direct thee in times of darkneſs and doubtings, when the Original of all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and the Fountain of all Wiſdom hath left thee? Indeed if thou let thy angry paſſions to rage upon every trifling occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thou doſt not only provoke God to be gone from thee, but to be gone in diſtaſt. 'Tis ſad when God conceals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but a little while from a poor Soul, and clouds his preſence a little while. A gracious Soul cannot bear a little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of God from it, when he lets out no intimations of diſpleaſure: but how terrible are the withdrawments of God, when he withdraws in high diſpleaſure, and thou knoweſt not whether he will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return again in mercy, or not? And it is ſaid in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.27. <hi>And with the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf unſavory.</hi> The
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:31630:88"/>
                  <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it, <hi>With the perverſe thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havest thy ſelf as one turned about;</hi> and that the very thoughts of God will be unſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and unpleaſant thoughts to them. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry froward perſons ſhall not have the leaſt diſcovery or ſenſe of Gods love while they are in their fits, nor much at other times, becauſe <hi>an angry froward frame of ſpirit is an abomination to the Lord, Prov.</hi> 3.32. &amp; chap. 8.13. &amp; 11.20. 'As froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cauſeth ſtrife between the neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, ſo it makes contention between God and the Soul. The angry froward perſon oppoſeth God, and God oppoſeth that perſon: So that hence it appears that thou haſt abundant cauſe and reaſon to uſe all poſſible means to reſtrain and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thy angry paſſions, becauſe they hinder thee from enjoying the divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and the hleſſed diſcoveries of divine Favour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou ſhould'ſt take great care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and ſuppreſs thy angry paſſions, and haſty frowardneſs of ſpirit, becauſe as they prevail, thy actings are as contrary to true grace, as any thing almoſt that thou canſt think of, and truly there may be a great deal of ſuſpicion whether thou
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:31630:89"/>haſt true Grace, or no. I conceive there may be ſome Analogy between a <hi>Nazarite</hi> and a gracious Soul. It is ſaid in <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.2. <hi>That the</hi> Nazarites <hi>were to ſeparate themſelves unto the Lord.</hi> They were to be ſeparated from the ordinary courſe of that they might more freely and wholly dedicate themſelves to the ſervice of God, and to a more ſtrict and pure courſe of ſerving God, than other men uſed; and indeed God confined them to ſtrict rules: They were to abſtain from any thing that did belong to the Vine; hereby alſo ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a full and perfect renouncing all worldly pleaſures, or any thing tending thoreunto; intimating, that they were not only to <hi>abstain from all evil,</hi> but <hi>all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of evil,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.22. All the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ceremonies injoyn'd them, were but Types of inward Holineſs. I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of one thing injoyned them, which is moſt eſpecially to my purpoſe, which is, <hi>That they ſhould drink no Vinegar of Wine, or any other ſtrong Liquor;</hi> that was to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that they muſt not be of Vinegar Spirits, of ſower and eager Spirits, but of of quiet Spirits, of loving and meek Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Now all the Saints of God they are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:31630:89"/>
                  <hi>Nazarites.</hi> As Chriſt was a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> ſo all that are Chriſts are <hi>Nazarites</hi> ſeperated from others to be the Lords people. The Lord ſeparates the godly man for himſelf, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3 <hi>But know that the Lord hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelf;</hi> and they muſt not be of harſh and hot Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but ſhould be adorned with this love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amiable grace of meekneſs: ſo that a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, froward and paſſionate Spirit is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to a meek, patient, and quie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Spirit; and if there be any grace in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perſon, it is rak'd up under a great deal of aſhes of corruption, that it is not eaſily diſcerned. Now the oppoſition that anger and frowardneſs bears to Grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If thou doſt conſider what it is that Grace doth in the heart when it firſt comes, the firſt thing is to ſhew unto the Soul its own vileneſs, its own wretchedneſs and baſeneſs by ſin, and the danger that it is in through ſin. Now a froward paſſionate heart is very contrary to the ſight of its own baſeneſs and vileneſs; for thou canſt not ſee thy ſelf to be a baſe, vile, ſinful worm, and yet bear nothing that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, but preſently thy heart is in a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:31630:90"/>flame if any thing doth croſs thee; for thou could'ſt not be ſo angry, if thou didſt not think thy ſelf too great and too good to be croſſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When Grace comes into the heart, it brings the heart into ſubjection unto God, and unto another rule than it wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by before. That's a principal work of Grace, to ſubdue the heart of a ſinner unto God. The hearts of ſinners are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſtout, and rebellious againſt God, and goes on in a ſtubborn way, till Grace comes, and lays them under; but a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and paſſionate heart would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed above God, and any of his rules. It cannot keep it ſelf under, and lie in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto rule; and hence is the reaſon that froward and paſſionate people uſe to have ſuch expreſſions, <hi>I will, nay but I will,</hi> and <hi>I care not,</hi> their hearts are ſubdued to the authority of God. But the heart that is ſubdued to the Lord, bring it but a Scripture, and it yields preſently; but a froward Spirit is not ſo. How contrary then is frowardneſs to Grace? I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in many other particulars, but I ſhall be too large then. O then, is paſſion and frowardneſs ſo oppoſite to Grace?
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:31630:90"/>doth it either hinder the working of grace in the heart, or at leaſt weaken, yea, ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace, that it is almoſt extinguiſh'd, tho' not totally, yet ſo as it is not eaſily diſcernable? Doſt thou not then ſee great reaſon to uſe all means to mortifie thy paſſions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thou ſhould'ſt uſe thy utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to mortifie thy paſſions, and live in peace with thy Husband or thy Wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou doſt manifeſt a truly noble and generous Spirit, if thou would'ſt paſs by offences without manifeſting anger and frowardneſs of Spirit. To this effect ſpeaks <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 19.11. <hi>It is the Glory of a man to paſs by a tranſgreſſion;</hi> that is, not to manifeſt an angry diſpleaſure for an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that another doth him. And ſo we ſay when we reſtrain our anger againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for any thing done amiſs, <hi>I will paſs you by for this time, I will not take any ſevere notice of what you have done.</hi> O it is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thing to bridle anger when a perſon is offended, to wink at ſmaller in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and remit greater wrongs. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Spirits are (as it were) impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by offences; yea, a Spirit truly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, a generous and noble Soul, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:31630:91"/>quiet, moderate, and grave, never ſuffering it ſelf to be tranſported with the violent motions of choler. Certainly a meek perſon hath a magnanimous and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Spirit. See what the wiſe man ſaith in <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.32. <hi>He that is ſlow to anger, is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City.</hi> He that overcometh himſelf, is ſtronger than one that overcometh a City. Now it is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing for a Souldier to overcome a City, but one that can overcome his own paſſion, is more valiant, and hath a more excellent Spirit, than one that overcomes a great City. And ſo ſome Creatures that are more heroical, are more meek and gentle than others are; The Lion is of a more generous Spirit than the Wolf is. The more honourable any one is, the more he is of a peaceable diſpoſition, and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is ſooner pacified. It is enough to fall down before a Lion, a Lion is pacified if you fall before him: but fot the Wolf and Tyger, and other baſer Creatures, they will tare thoſe that fall down before them. Hence obſerve, ſuch as are ſoon moved to violent paſſions, that will not paſs by a ſlight offence, but will be furious for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:31630:91"/>trifle, they are of ignoble, baſe, ſordid tempers, of vile, wretched, and dunghil diſpoſitions. O then, what care ſhould'ſt thou take to watch againſt the firſt riſings of anger, and faithfully endeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thy violent paſſions when riſen, to wink and connive at many offences! If ever thou wilt evidence a noble Spirit, it is thy true glory ſo to do; but 'tis thy ignominy and diſgrace to be of a Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-Spirit, to be tranſported into a flame of fury by every little ſpark of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſt given. Nay, a furious Spirit is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Spirit, and therefore the Devils are very often called <hi>Furies.</hi> O let this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſtir thee up to endeavor after meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, calmneſs, and peaceablenſs of Spirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thou ſhould'ſt be careful to abſtain from anger and frowardneſs of Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing that thou canſt do in anger, but thou may'ſt do it better out of anger. Thou canſt have thy mind or thy will in nothing in anger, but thou may'ſt have thy mind and will better out of an angry fit. And wherefore then ſhould'ſt thou be angry? Conſider when thou haſt thine anger ſtirring, what thou would'ſt do in thine anger. Thou may it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:31630:92"/>ſay, <hi>I would reprove my Wife or my Husband that hath done amiſs.</hi> I ſay, thou muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove without anger, thou muſt <hi>reſtore with a ſpirit of meekneſs, Gal.</hi> 6.1. There is no recovering a fallen Relation from ſin in a boiſterous way. There are gentle means, that are moſt influential. Thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof ſhould be as Phyſick: thou doſt not uſe to give Phyſick ſcalding hot. Thou may'ſt reprove thy Wife, Husband, Child, or Servant, without anger, as well as with anger; and if thou would'ſt give corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, thou may'ſt do it beſt without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. If thou doſt correct in anger, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in anger, thy Servant or any other Relation will think it is rather from <hi>thy fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> than <hi>his fault</hi> that thou do'ſt it. Perhaps thou would'ſt do ſome ſpecial ſervice for God, and thou ſay'ſt that anger will quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thee: But <hi>James</hi> ſaith, cap. 1.20. <hi>The wrath of man accompliſheth not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God.</hi> God will not be beholding to the wrath of man for any thing. An Heathen could ſay, <hi>That Fortitude had no need of wrath, no need of gall, bitterneſs and choler, but it may be well enough without it.</hi> Perhaps thou would'ſt make thine Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſenſible of the wrong he had done
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:31630:92"/>thee: That thou may'ſt do without anger. If he hath wronged thee, ſhew him the more reſpect and kindneſs; this way thou ſhalt make him ſenſible of the wrong he hath done thee, as well as any way in the world, that it will either melt his heart, or trouble his Spirit, till he hath made thee reſtitution, or confeſſed his fault. I ſay, every thing can be better done in a calm and quiet frame, than in an angry fit; for in thine anger thou canſt not ſol well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thy reaſon as at another time; for the fire of paſſion, when it is kindled, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a great ſmoak to come up to the Underſtanding and Judgment, and even puts out thy Reaſon. So that is very great reaſon why thou ſhould'ſt uſe all means to prevent and ſuppreſs thine angry paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thou ſhould'ſt do thy utmoſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from anger, and attain meekneſs of ſpirit, becauſe meekneſs is that grace whereby men and women come to have fair weather all the year long. It is a comfortable thing to have fair weather to continue but two or three weeks together, and thou knoweſt that rainy weather and dropping weather is very tedious and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:31630:93"/>to us, and we ſay, <hi>It is pity fair weather ſhould do any hurt:</hi> But when Husband and Wife are both meek, there is fair weather in that Family every day, all the week long. But where they are froward and paſſionate, there is rainy weather all the week long. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſets out paſſion and frowardneſs by <hi>a continual dropping, Prov.</hi> 19.13. <hi>And the contentions of a Wife are a continual dropping;</hi> her ſcolding and braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling may occaſion much ſadneſs, trouble, and hurt in the Family. And ſo in <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.15. <hi>A continual dropping in a very rainy day, and a contentious woman, are alike.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> renders it, <hi>A continual dropping in a day of a great ſhower of rain, and a Wife of brawlings and contentions, are alike.</hi> Where the rain drops into an houſe, it is very troubleſom; but when the Sun comes in at the window, there is a ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant dwelling, that is comfortable. Many times thou knoweſt that the Sun riſeth very fair in the morning, but it rains mightily before night: So in many Families, tho' there is a great deal of quietneſs in the morning, and there ſeemeth to be a great deal of love between Husband and Wife, yet what a ſtorm is there before night!
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:31630:93"/>and the reaſon is, becauſe a paſſionate perſon looks on that as a great crime, which a meek perſon can ſee no evil at all in. Where there is meekneſs, there fair weather continues always. Now, tho' paſſion and frowardneſs be uncomely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all, and meekneſs is lovely in all. But paſſion is more uncomely, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is more ſweet and lovely between Man and Wife: they ſhould walk ſweetly and lovingly together when God by ſuch an Ordinance of his hath ſo united them in ſuch a way of Communion as they are united. Such God hath joyned by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinance of Marriage, that indeed is a greater bond than the bond of Nature; for <hi>a man and woman muſt forſake all Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and cleave to one another, and of twain become one fleſh.</hi> And ſhould they not be of one mind? O then, how careful ſhould Husband and Wife be to avoid thoſe angry paſſions that hinder that ſweetneſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and delight which they might enjoy, were they of patient and meek Spirits! Meekneſs of Spirit makes them very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in diſcharging mutual duties to each other, and that keeps fair weather between them: but paſſion makes them oppoſe the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:31630:94"/>commands of the Goſpel, and that makes tempeſtuous weather between them. The Scripture ſays, <hi>Wives, ſee that you reverence your Husbands:</hi> when then thou doſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke thy Husband, and ſpeak it to him in a froward way, I appeal to thy conſcience, <hi>Doſt thou reverence thy Husband?</hi> Thou may'ſt ſay, <hi>he doth not deſerve it.</hi> Whether he deſerve it or no, thou art to reverence him; thou muſt reverence him in words, geſtures, actions, and in thy very heart, and not give him inſolent and reflecting language, or like <hi>Zepora, Exod.</hi> 24 25. call him <hi>a bloody Husband.</hi> God hath made Marriage a union for communion, for love, for help, for peace, for delight; and thou doſt by thy angry paſſions do what in thee lies to fruſtrate the very Ordinance of God. Know, that God will not bear it at thine hands, to fruſtrate that great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his. Let the Wife then conſider the Husband as one that God commands <hi>that ſhe ſhould reverence and obey in all things that are not ſinful;</hi> and let the Husband conſider the Wife as the weaker Veſſel, and bear with her ſinleſs infirmities: This is the way to keep fair and comfortable weather always between them. But the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:31630:94"/>Wife may come under the firſt head of <hi>Inferiours.</hi> God hath put her in an inferiour condition, and therefore frowardneſs and paſſion is very uncomely in her. O then, as ever you would prevent tempeſtuous weather between you, as ever you would maintain love, comfort, and quietneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you, ſtrive to refrain from angry paſſions, endeavour to get your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with the grace of meekneſs. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſtill you are one fleſh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be no more offended with the words and failings of each other, than you would if they were your own, for you cannot be free from failings till you have attain'd full perfection, which is not to be gotten in this life. Fall out no more with your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands or with your Wives for their words or faulty actions, than you would with your ſelves for your own faults, or your own words of common and ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. This will allow you ſuch an anger or diſpleaſure againſt a fault, as tendeth to heal it, but not ſuch as tendeth to vex and feſter the diſeaſed part. This will turn anger into compaſſion, and a ſpeedy dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for the cure. Conſider this, I pray, and avoid all occaſions of wrath and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:31630:95"/>out: Do not do any thing to contract a diſcontented peeviſh habit; do not in your impatiency wrangle and diſquiet one another, ſpeak not reproachful and provoking words, talking hotly doth blow the fire, and increaſe the flame. Be but ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and you will ſooner return to your ſerenity and peace. Some calm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending words of reaſon may ſtop the torrent, and revive the reaſon which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had overcome. Foul words, as they tend to diſgrace and diſpleaſe one another, ſo they produce many evil effects. After Thunder comes Rain. Do not then caſt on Oyl or Fewel, by anſwering one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provokingly or ſharply, or by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying words, or by anſwering wrath with wrath. You muſt endeavour to molifie, &amp; not exaſperate one another. O that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might prevail with you to take this courſe! O then in how much ſweetneſs, amity, and peace might you live with one another!</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider that no excuſe or pretence whatſoever can juſtifie your being angry with one another. Thou may'ſt ſay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, <hi>O Husband, or O wife, I am of a very haſty and cholerick nature, and cannot leave
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:31630:95"/>it, but ſhall be ſoon angry when occaſion is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> This vain excuſe is no better than <hi>Adam</hi>'s fig-leaves to hide the nakedneſs of ſin, and will not juſtifie thy furious paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for if thou art of a paſſionate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thou haſt a nature that is abominable to God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.32. <hi>For the froward is an abomination to the Lord;</hi> that is, which God eſteemeth and accounteth an abomination; for when the heart is froward, <hi>the perſon deviſeth miſchief continually; and ſoweth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> cap. 6.14. This frowardneſs in the heart, as it intimates perverſeneſs of the heart, ſo alſo a paſſionate nature: So none are more obſtinate and perverſe than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry perſons, and are the cauſers of great diſſentions and diſagreements; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch God hates, becauſe <hi>he loveth tranſgreſſion that loveth ſtrife,</hi> cap. 17.19. An angry nature is always brawling, and contention is the original cauſe of many ſins, which the contentious perſon by his actings ſeemeth to love: therefore do not plead <hi>thy nature</hi> by way of excuſe. If thy nature be cholerick, it is not the nature that God created thee in, for God made man upright, <hi>after his own Image,</hi> like himſelf, who <hi>is ſlow to anger.</hi> It is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:31630:96"/>of God to be ſlow to wrath, and thy froward nature is not Gods nature, it is but thy original corruption. Thou art fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and thy original corruption is in the ſtrength of it. Is this any leſſening of the evil of the root, becauſe it hath corrupt branches? or will it leſſen the evil of a Child, becauſe it had a wicked Father? And therefore thou art not to excuſe one ſin with another, but rather earneſtly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that this pollution may be waſhed away with the water of Gods Spirit, who by his <hi>Grace</hi> doth reform <hi>Nature.</hi> If thou art of ſuch a wicked diſpoſition that thou canſt not but be angry, thy ſin is the more heinous, and thy ſtate the more dangerous; for <hi>rooted ſickneſs</hi> is worſe than <hi>new-bred,</hi> an <hi>old ſore</hi> than a <hi>green wound.</hi> The fins that are ſet moſt deep in nature, are moſt hateful and dangerous: therefore thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a cholerick nature ſhould be thy <hi>humiliation,</hi> not thy <hi>excuſe;</hi> for if thou haſt nothing but nature, nothing to overcome thy nature, thou ſhalt never go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for every man and woman in the world, that hath the leaſt degree of grace, is made partaker of the Divine Nature, Now the Divine Nature, that prevails
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:31630:96"/>reigns, and rules in the heart; therefore to plead <hi>Nature</hi> to excuſe <hi>Anger,</hi> is as much as to ſay, <hi>I am yet the child of wrath, therefore I cannot ceaſe to be angry.</hi> O thou may'ſt ſay, <hi>I am fleſh and blood, and how can I be able to be of ſuch a quiet and meek ſpirit when I am wronged? indeed it is very difficult.</hi> 'Tis true, all good things are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and meekneſs would not be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a grace, were it not difficult to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: but it is difficult only to thoſe that have no gracious principles in them. An endeavour to conquer thy paſſions may ſeem difficult at firſt; but try once or twice, and thou wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If thou art but fleſh and blood, ſhall vile fleſh and blood take ſo much upon it, as (if it be croſt in any thing) to flie in the face of God, and revile thy deareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and croſs Gods will. 'Tis ſad that fleſh and blood ſhould do this. And I tell thee, if ever thou be ſaved, thou muſt be more than fleſh and blood, for fleſh and blood ſhall never enter into the Kingdom
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:31630:97"/>of Heaven. But thou may'ſt ſay, <hi>I am greatly provoked, I ſhould live quietly with my Husband, and in my Family, except I be provoked; and it is his fault who provokes me, rather than mine who am angry.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>There was no need indeed of the grace of meekneſs, if there was nothing to provoke thee. The Devil's meek when he's pleas'd: but for thee to ſay that thou art meek, whereas thou art meek only when thou art pleaſed, that is no meekneſs. Now is the time for thee to exerciſe meekneſs when thou art provoked, to forbear angry paſſions when thou art croſſed. To ſay thou art froward only when thou art provoked, is as much as to ſay,</hi> I am not froward, but when God calls upon me to exerciſe meekneſs: <hi>For whenever thou art provoked, that is the proper time to exerciſe meekneſs. And it is a ſign of a very carnal heart, to put off thy ſin to the temptation; that when thou haſt done evil, thou ſay'ſt,</hi> Such an one did provoke me to it, or this wicked Devil did tempt me to it: <hi>whereas 'twere only thy corruptions that made thee furious; whereas thoſe that are truly gracious, and are of tender ſpirits, are ready to charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the uttermoſt for any evil. They judge that all the evil of their lives d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th ariſe from
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:31630:97"/>the wicked corruptions of their hearts: but a carnal heart will charge temptation with all, and would free himſelf, and diſcharge his corruptions from that which doth ariſe wholly from corruption, and from no other principle. So that it is more of inward corruption than outward provocation that thou art ſo paſſionate. A little occaſion may provoke thee to paſſion, but a great matter will not provoke thee to good works. Why ſhould any thing provoke thee do thy ſelf a miſchief? Thou canſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a Beaſt (with all the blows thou canſt give him) to leap into the fire: and why art thou ſo eaſily provoked to miſchief thy ſelf in the fire of paſſion?</hi> O conſider how thou doſt provoke God continually, and thou ſhould'ſt labour to be as God is. He is not ſo angry upon all thy provocations as to flie upon thee: He can bear, tho' thou provoke him, and why ſhould'ſt thou not bear when thy fellow-Creatures provoke thee? Perhaps thou may'ſt ſay, <hi>There was never any one ſo abuſed as I am; never any one had ſuch an Husband as I have.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Certainly this is the pride of thy heart to think or ſay ſo. A proud heart being great it ſelf, makes every little affliction, every little croſs ſeem great. By reaſon of thy pride of heart
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:31630:98"/>thou thinkeſt it a great matter to ſuffer any little thing. Hadſt thou an humble heart, thou would'st not think it a great matter to ſuffer, and know that God is more abus'd every day, than thou art, or ever could'ſt be. An humble heart ſays,</hi> Doth the Lord ſend ſuch afflictions upon me more than on any other? The Lord ſees I have a more vile heart than any other, and therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve more afflictions than another. <hi>And certainly if thou art more froward than others, therefore thou doſt meet with more evil than others, becauſe thou art a froward perſon. The Lord ſees thy heart ſo vile in thy frowardneſs, that thou tendreſt not Gods glory, therefore he tenders not thy good. There is no perſon in the world that doth meet with ſo much occaſion of vexation, as a froward perſon doth: and if thou didst but paſs a right judgment, thou would'ſt find that others ſuffer as much as thou doſt, nay more, yea, it may be they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more by thee than thou doſt by them: thou art more an afflicter to them, than they are to thee. So that it is clear that no pretence or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe that thou canſt make can juſtifie thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry paſſions with thy Husband or with thy Wife, but ſtill thy paſſions will be ſinful. And ſhould'ſt thou not then do thy utmoſt to reſtrain
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:31630:98"/>and ſuppreſs thy violent paſſions? ſhould not ſuch a conſideration make thee ceaſe contending with ſo near a Relation as an Husband or a Wife? Pray then mind the directions given thee to prevent thy furiouſneſs of ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Thou ſhould'ſt be very watchful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy anger and frowardneſs of ſpirit, becauſe nothing in the world doth more diſcover thy ſhame and folly, than thy angry paſſion. Therefore 'tis obſervable how many times the Scripture couples <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>folly</hi> together, and makes <hi>paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate people</hi> the <hi>fooliſheſt people</hi> in the world. When thou art provoked, thy paſſion doth diſcover what is in thee, which is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered until then. Whatever ſhameful thing is in thee, will quickly diſcover it ſelf in thine anger. Indeed thy carriage is ſo foul and vile in thy paſſion, that thy nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Relation is aſham'd of thee. Certainly one would wonder to ſee the ſhameful carriage of ſome men and women in their paſſions. I have heard of a Wife that fell out with her Husband for a trifle, only for the moving of his hand in ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and becauſe by her bitter provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſpeeches ſhe could not move him to the like furiouſneſs of ſpirit, ſhe told him,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:31630:99"/>
                  <hi>He was of a gangrene ſpirit, and that he was of ſo ſordid and baſe dunghil ſpirit, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would move him;</hi> and fretted the more exceedingly, that he did bear her railings ſo patiently: For he knowing that the Scripture forbad him to render revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for reviling, bore all her provocations with admirable patience. Alſo I have heard of a Wife, when her Husband would not do ſuch things as ſhe would have him, (which he did judge not convenient to be done) ſhe would pluck him by the hair, ſometimes ſtrike him on the face, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the head. At divers other times in her rage (which ſhe would be often in, ſhe knew not why her ſelf,) ſhe would give him ſuch inſulting, bitter, reviling, reproachful, diſdainful, and imperious ſpeeches, as are not fit to be mentioned. Both theſe perſons I knew my ſelf, and do know what I have written to be true; and I have mentioned this inſtance to ſhew the ſhameful acts that perſons are guilty of in their paſſions. Some Wives are ſo proud and paſſionate, that nothing but a ſubmiſſive obedience to their inſolent and unreaſonable commands will gratifie them; and if their Husbands think it too much to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:31630:99"/>be ſubject to the commands of an inferior, they ſhall not be permitted to live in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. And I know one Wife that told her Husband, for not gratifying her perverſe humour, <hi>that it was no matter if he had been buried alive, rather than have married her.</hi> And alſo I have known an Husband who in his furious paſſion ſaid, <hi>that he did wiſh the Devil would come and fetch away his Wife,</hi> who was a ſerious, holy, and meek woman. And ſhould'ſt thou not be aſhamed of thy paſſions, that make thee guilty of ſuch ſhameful carriages? Indeed in ſuch ſhameful carriages paſſionate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſcover the greateſt folly imaginable. O then it is great folly to give way to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.9. ſaith, <hi>that anger reſteth in the boſom of fools;</hi> and in <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.16. <hi>A fools wrath is preſently known, but a prudent man covereth his ſhame.</hi> A fools wrath is known by his words, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and geſtures; his wrath is vented in raſh and ill-adviſed ſpeeches, which hurt his Neighbour, whereby the folly of the angry perſon is diſcovered, and ſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his or her ſhame. But a prudent man (that is, a meek man) by his forbearing to be angry covereth his ſhame. And in <hi>Prov.</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:31630:100"/>14.17. it is ſaid, <hi>He that is ſoon angry dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth fooliſhly:</hi> and in ver. 29. <hi>He that is ſlow to wrath, is of great underſtanding: but he that is haſty of ſpirit, exalteth folly.</hi> The meek perſon hath much underſtanding, which he diſcovereth by this, in that he knoweth how to bear wrongs and injuries patiently, and can beware of doing any thing that doth truly oppoſe Honour and Virtue: But he or ſhe that is haſty of mind, or ſhort of ſpirit, that is ſoon angry, <hi>exalteth folly;</hi> that is, bringeth his folly to open light, to be ſeen of all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foraſmuch as he or ſhe doth in his or her anger thoſe things which cannot conſiſt with Honour and Virtue. Thus continually the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth befool paſſionate people, and it is to check froward people, becauſe there are none that think themſelves wiſer than angry people do, eſpecially in the time of their fit. Certainly, becauſe angry perſons diſcover great folly in opening their ſhame, they make evident what filthy traſh was cloſetted up in their hearts, which was not known before. Alas! of what ridiculous, rude, and indiſcreet acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are angry perſons daily guilty of; they will reverence no Superiour, reſpect
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:31630:100"/>no Equal, but contemn all that oppoſe their humour. Their chief work is railing and vilifying others much ſuperiour to themſelves in real worth: They are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding talkative, all others muſt hold their peace but themſelves: and in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their words there wanteth not folly. But in all theſe inſolent, imperious, and inſulting carriages of a Wife to her Husband, where is the reverence and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance that God requires her to give him? for reverence is due to a man as he is an Husband; to the bad Husband, as well as to the good; to the poor Husband, as well as to the rich: So that no defect of the Husband can excuſe the Wife from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him due reverence and ſubjection to his ſuperiority. So that all the irreverent ſpeeches ſhe gives her Husband in her paſſion, are but the diſcoveries of her ſhame and folly.</p>
               <p>I have now ended my Arguments and Motives which I have laid before you to perſuade you to uſe the directions that I have here given to prevent Wrath and Diſcord between Husband and Wife. Pray then let thoſe conſiderations influence you to watch againſt your angry paſſions; do
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:31630:101"/>not allow your ſelves in that which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſo much of your ſhame and folly, that ſuch near Relations by their furoius carriages one to another ſhould make themſelves ridiculous to all that know them, is very ſad. You are one fleſh, be of one ſpirit and one heart, be faithful to diſcharge the duty you owe to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Be not too curious in obſerving e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very look or geſture of one another. Wink at every thing that croſſeth you, ſo long as it doth not croſs the will of God. Let each of you keep in your own ſtation. Let not the Wife look for ſuperiority, when God hath appointed her ſubjection. Let her not be ambitious of teaching, when her place is to be a learner. A chearful ſubjection to Gods Ordinances, and a ready delightful ſubmiſſion to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential appointments, is an excellent means to keep peace, and prevent conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between Man and Wife. It is a great occaſion of ſtrife, when that party will preſcribe rules to the other, that ought to be ruled by the other. Do not diſcover your folly by your inſolent carriages one to another. Do not allow your paſſions, that will make you utter ſuch expreſſions
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:31630:101"/>that will prove your ſhame. Be willing to live in peace one with another. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be perſuaded by the Arguments and Motives that I have here given, to uſe the direction now lay'd before you, to prevent Wrath and Diſcord between you.</p>

            <head>THE APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>SOme Wives plead in excuſe of their fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriages to their Husbands thus: <hi>None ought to account my zeal for Gods glory in a ſmart reprehenſion of my Husbands miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, to be ſinful anger; for I muſt not let my Husband alone to diſhonour God, becauſe my not appearing for God when my Husband offends him, will intimate an approbation of his ſinful ways. I cannot be faithful to God, except I do oppoſe him in ſuch actions as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive are not good: and in this reſpect I judg not my ſelf blame-worthy in contending with him. Is it not my duty to reprove my Husband when he offends God, and deals injuriouſly with me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Meeting with this Plea ſince I compos'd the fore-going <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> I have added this following <hi>Anſwer,</hi> as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the former diſcourſe; which is, <hi>That I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that ſome endeavoars may be uſed by Wives to convince their Husbands of their ſins, and to reform their converſations. But by
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:31630:104"/>an explanation of the nature of Reproof it will appear what method is proper to be uſed by Wives to reclaim their Husbands from their diſorderly walkings.</hi> — To <hi>Reprove</hi> in a ſtrict ſenſe denotes an authority in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover</hi> over the <hi>Reproved;</hi> for reproving is an act of authority, which a perſon hath by vertue of <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Relation;</hi> as in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Rebuke with all authority:</hi> In this ſenſe a ſuperiour is not to be reproved. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Rebuke not an Elder.</hi> I underſtand it not only of the <hi>Aged,</hi> but of <hi>all Superiours</hi> in Place &amp; Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; a tart reprehenſion, or a direct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, is not to be given them by Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: they are to be dealt with as Fathers are to be dealt with by their Children, they may be <hi>deſired,</hi> but not <hi>rebuked.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them as a Father.— <hi>Admonitions</hi> are given by ſuch as are Equals of the ſame Degree and Quality, of the ſame Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Corporation, or Chriſtian Society, which are either finding fault with each other for ſins committed, or perſuading or exhorting unto duties which have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: And I look on admonitions to be of a more inferiour quality than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes which Superiours give to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:31630:104"/>for altho' an admonition be given as an act of Duty, yet not as an act of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as the other is. But that way which I conceive an Inferiour may take to reclaim a Superiour from ſin, and yet not go out of his place, or uſurp authority which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to him, is by an humble, earneſt, and reſpectful intreating the Superiour to forbear his ſinful acts, which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited him to concern himſelf with, &amp; to engage in thoſe Chriſtian duties which God requires him to perform. So that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that there is a time when in a limitted ſenſe inferiours may uſe means to hinder their ſuperiours going on in a way of ſin. <hi>Job.</hi> 31.13. Superiours are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove inſtruction or humble advice, their authority doth not give them a toleration to perſevere in ſin, nor a liberty to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their inferiours under their feet. Tho' we are under our Superiours Power, yet we are not under their Luſts; tho' we are to be governed by them, yet not to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed by them. As we ought to ſerve, ſo they ought to govern, in the fear of God; and Superiours irregularities are to be hinted to them in an humble manner, and Superiours ought to act as men accompta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:31630:105"/>to an Higher Power; and thoſe which are above others on Earth, are to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med when they offend God in Heaven. He which is <hi>Superiour</hi> in one reſpect, is <hi>Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> in another. The Husband which hath Dominion over his Wife, is under Gods Dominion. Tho' he is above his Wife, yet he is not above Gods Law. Gods Law muſt oblige the Husband as well as the Wife; and when the Husband breaks Gods Law, he may be lawfully told of it by his Wife in a regular and humble manner, ſo that ſhe doth always manifeſt a reverence to the ſuperiority God hath placed in her Husband.</p>
            <p>But many Wives think that they are not at all inferiour to their Husbands. They conclude that they are equal with them in all things, becauſe by the Marriage-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they become one fleſh. Other Wives are not ſatisfied, except their Husbands carry it towards them as perſons ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to them, and in the pride of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſpeak to their Husbands in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly language as to their Inferiours, and will revile their Husbands if they do not in every thing ſubject themſelves to their croſs, perverſe, and froward humours, &amp;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:31630:105"/>bear with all their inſolent carriages; and this they will do under pretence of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Husbands miſcarriages; and they will be always contending with their Husbands, if their Husbands will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be in ſubjection to them, whereby they ſeldom live in peace with each other.</p>
            <p>In order to the reformation of this great diſorder in Wives carriages to their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands;</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall endeavour to convince them that their Husbands have a right of ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall give ſome cautions to Wives to prevent their inſulting over their Husbands under a pretence of reproving their faults, that they may not preſume to exerciſe any kind of authority over them, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires them to be ſubject unto, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in acquaint them with the proper method God allows them to take in admoniſhing their Husbands.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall direct them both how to carry themſelves to thoſe that are ſubordinate to them both; for their proper carriage to their inferiours in their Families will be a ſpecial help to preſerve peace between them.</p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:31630:106"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To prove the Husbands right of ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, that the titles given the Husband in Scripture doth prove his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority and the Wives ſubjection. The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is called <hi>the Wifes Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Being in ſubjection to their own Husbands, even as</hi> Sarah <hi>obey'd</hi> Abraham, <hi>calling him Lord.</hi> So in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.12. He is her Maſter, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 1.17, 22. <hi>Her Head,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Her Guide, Prov.</hi> 2.17. <hi>She forſaketh the guide of her youth;</hi> which is meant of her Husband, whom ſhe married in her youth, and whom by marriage ſhe received as the guide of her youth under God, who is to be her guide both in youth and old age, and by forſaking the government of her Husband in his commands, directions and counſels, ſhe forgetteth the Covenant of God made in marriage. All theſe expreſſions do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Husbands ſuperiority and the Wives ſubordination &amp; orderly ſubjection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Wife was made after man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe ſhould not go before man. 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 2.12, 13. Adam <hi>was firſt formed, then</hi> Eve; therefore ſhe muſt not uſurp authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the man; ſhe muſt not be a Teacher, but a Learner in ſilence with all ſubjection;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:31630:106"/>Teaching and reproving is taking an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon her which belongs not to her. The <hi>Woman was made of Man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.8. ſhe received her being (under God) from man: now the Effect is ever leſs noble, and inferiour to the Cauſe. <hi>The woman was made for man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.9. that which ſerveth to any end, is leſs than the end to which it ſerveth. And <hi>the woman is the glory of the man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7. as he hath ſo excellent a Creature as a Woman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with reaſon, as himſelf, ſubject to him. Dominion in this caſe being mans priviledge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Thy deſire ſhall be to thy Husband, and he ſhall rule over thee.</hi> The ſuperiority that God hath given man to enjoy, ſhall he not enjoy it as God hath given it. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.22, 23, 24. <hi>Wives ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves unto your own Husbands, as to the Lord.</hi> Some Wives are not convinc'd that they owe this ſubjection to their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands as the Scripture requireth, but in truth every Wife owes it to her own Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, tho' he comes ſhort of others in Knowledge, Wiſdom, Education, Eſtate, and every other thing which doth deſerve it. For the great and main duty which a Wife (as a Wife) ought to learn, and ſo
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:31630:107"/>learn as to practice, is, to be ſubject to her Husband; and <hi>Paul</hi> holds it forth as the ſum of all other duties. And there is no Wife, whatever be her Birth, Parts, Portion, Breeding, or any other Priviledge, who is exempted from this tie of <hi>ſubjection to her own Husband:</hi> The Law of Nature, Gods Ordinance, and her own voluntary Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, binds her to it; and there is not any Husband to whom this honour of <hi>ſubjection</hi> is not due; no perſonal infirmities, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of nature, no nor error in point of Religion, doth deprive him of it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided her ſubmiſſion be in thoſe things which are conſiſtent with her love to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And the Wifes ſubjection ought to flow from the conſcience of, and reſpect to that ſtate and dignity wherein God hath placed her Husband above her, which ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her to reverence, and obey him. For, as I ſaid before, <hi>the Husband is the Head of the Wife,</hi> and this <hi>ſubjection to the Husband ought to be in every thing</hi> (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.24.) <hi>which is not forbidden in the word of God,</hi> tho' it croſs the humour of the Wife, and argue little diſcretion in the Husband that commandeth it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wives are oblig'd to be in ſubjection
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:31630:107"/>to their Husbands by their Marriage-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, wherein they have promis'd <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Husbands:</hi> and Marriage-promiſes muſt be performed. Now, <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> is an act of ſubjection, and an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of inferiority: ſo that ſuch Wives as are not willing to conſent to their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands ſuperiority, are not willing to be faithful to their own engagements. Indeed God will be very ſevere againſt ſuch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as make no conſcience of obſerving their Marriage-covenant, for it is Gods Covenant made in his name. God is the Author of it, as he is the Ordainer of that ſtate of Marriage: and it is made in Gods preſence, ſo he is a witneſs to it. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.14. <hi>And this Covenant is Gods Covenant, becauſe he will avenge the breach of it.</hi> God will certainly ſeverely avenge the quarrel of his Covenant, when men and women are the only expreſſed parties in the Covenant; and God made <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſmart ſorely for breaking his Covenant with the King of <hi>Babylon. Ezek.</hi> 17.16, 19. Zedekiah <hi>gave his band to confirm his Covenant made to the King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>that he would be ſubject to him:</hi> ſo Wives give their hands to their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in Marriage, <hi>that they will be obedient
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:31630:108"/>to them:</hi> They cannot look upon their own hands, and not remember how they were engaged. So that God ſwears, <hi>As ſure as I am God, you ſhall feel the weight of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure for your perfideouſneſs.</hi> The King of Heaven doth regard his Oath, and if the Lord once ſwear, he will perform, &amp; there ſhall be no eſcaping of what he hath threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened. Indeed, as I ſaid before, Oaths and Covenants made with men are Divine things, and not to be ſlighted. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that was made with an Heatheniſh King, and an Idolater, God owns as made with himſelf, becauſe his ſacred &amp; dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Name was uſed therein: therefore God ſaid, <hi>Mine Oath that he hath deſpiſed, and Covenant that he hath broken.</hi> Violating of Covenants falſifying of promiſes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideous doings, are exceeding evil, and God will make ſuch as violate their own word exemplary to all the world, &amp; they ſhall live in perpetual infamy So if Wives forget the Covenant of their God made in Marriage, God will remember their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, and recompence their Perjury upon their own heads; for every diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Wife is in a ſence a perjur'd Wife, &amp; if they think to looſe the bonds of this <hi>Oath,</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:31630:108"/>and <hi>Marriage-Covenant,</hi> they will find and feel the blow of the Curſe mentioned in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.20, 21, 25. O what a fearful fire and fury, what dreadful death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is here threatned by the God of truth againſt them that break <hi>his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant!</hi> By which it is fully evident, that it is the duty of Wives to manifeſt their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their Husbands, according to their Marriage-Covenant.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If Wives are not willing to ſubject themſelves to the authority of their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, it is becauſe they do not really love them as God commands them. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>That they may teach the young women to be ſober, to love their Husbands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their own Husbands, that the word of God be not blaſphemed.</hi> God gives this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, <hi>that the Wifes love muſt proceed from the obedience of the Scripture:</hi> And where the Wife loves her Husband in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, there will be an orderly ſubjection of the Wife to the ſuperiority of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. When the Wife queſtions the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands right of ſuperiority, ſhe hath little love to his perſon; for Obedience is the evidence of love, and ſuch Wives will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonour their Husbands authority, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:31630:109"/>look upon their perſons and actions through the ſpectacles of love. But the Wife doth practically diſown her Husbands authority over her, that neglects to obſerve the lawful commands of her Husband, or doth oppoſe him in doing lawful actions, or gives him imperious and inſulting lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. If a Wife doth really love her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, her yoke of <hi>ſubjection</hi> will not be grievous to her. As love to God doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſweeten his ſervice, and make it not only more acceptable to him, but alſo more delightful to us, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. So the Wifes love to her Husband will abundantly ſweeten her <hi>ſubjection</hi> to him. But if a Wife refuſeth to give <hi>ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to her Husband, and would be equal with him, or ſuperior to him, ſhe loves him not at all. Let the Wife pretend what ſhe will for neglecting the manifeſtations of her love to her Husband, by ſubmiſſion to his authority over her by Gods inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the want of diſcretion, breeding, &amp; other good qualities, which other Husbands have, or had: I muſt tell ſuch a Wife, That not the good diſpoſition of Husbands, or their excellent accompliſhments, but the good pleaſure of God, ought to be the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:31630:109"/>ground of Wives love to their Husbands, which they muſt evidence by an obſervance of all their lawful injunctions, &amp; then they will do them good and not evil all the days of their lives, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.12. By per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ſeveral duties of their places, by honouring their perſons, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their lawful pleaſure. Some Wives murmur at the yoke of ſubjection, but truly th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y have more cauſe to complain of their want of affection; for women that love their Husbands will count their moderate commands, and whatſoever they do for them, both eaſie and delightful. If then, O Wife, thou canſt ſay, <hi>That thou haſt choſen thy Husband for thy Love,</hi> then love thy choice, and grudge not to ſubmit thy ſelf to his authority. Now this being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>That the Husband is the Wifes ſuperiour,</hi> I ſhall give Wives thoſe following cautions in admoniſhing their Husbands of their ſins and miſcarriages.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let Wives beware they do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend cauſe to reprove their Husbands out of a deſire to uſurp that authority to themſelves which is due to their Husbands. Many think their Husbands deſerve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof for not carefully obſerving their
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:31630:110"/>wills: They look for obedience in every thing from their Husbands, and think them guilty of a great crime if they do in any wiſe neglect to gratifie their perverſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. But I ſay, 'tis not the croſſing of the Wifes pettiſh humour, but Gods will, that deſerves reproof. Some Wives account their Husbands denying them the liberty of diſpoſing all Family-concerns according to their own pleaſure, to be a crime that deſerves a ſmart reproof: They muſt rule all things, and manage all things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or elſe the houſe will be too hot for their Husbands to abide in. Such Husbands deſerve to be pitied whoſe outward beings by ſuch Wives have been made as miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as poſſible on this ſide Hell. The true ground of many Wives exclamations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Husbands is a conceit that they do not rule enough, they think they are too much oppoſed in their wills. <hi>O they cry out of ſuch as vile Husbands as will not le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> them ſay what they will, and do what they will.</hi> Many Women are noted for queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and quarrelling at their Husbands po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but few are noted for obeying their Husbands pleaſure. Therefore you Wives that may read this Treatiſe, conſider with
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:31630:110"/>your ſelves, whether you have not been offended with your Husbands, &amp; pretended cauſe to manifeſt your diſpleaſure againſt your Husbands, becauſe your proud ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are not willing to be in that ſubjection God hath placed you, and becauſe you'd exerciſe an authority above your places, &amp; ſo will pretend faults in your Husbands to juſtifie your own preſumptions reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, that ſo you might make them ſtoop to your humours; and if they do not, they ſhall have no quiet in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Indeed this is a very great evil in Wives, and highly provoking to God, and they ſin in reproving their Husbands on ſuch an account. Therefore I would cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Wives to beware that they do not find fault with their Husbands upon ſuch a ground: And to enforce this caution, I pray obſerve,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That a commanding inſulting Wife, who ſaith to her Husband,</hi> you ſhall do this, <hi>or</hi> you ſhall not do it, <hi>inverts the Order of Nature, as well as that of the Creator.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That a Family is infamous where the Wife like</hi> Jezabel <hi>rules all, and the Husband like</hi> Ahab <hi>lets her do what ſhe liſt without contradiction. Where the Wife gets the upper-hand
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:31630:111"/>of the Husband, the next thing that is to be expected is an eclipſe of the honour of that houſe.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Conſider if you pretend cauſe to reprove your Husbands becauſe they would keep you in ſubjection to them, according to Gods command, you do not make conſcience of rendring obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God. 'Tis not a ſufficient excuſe for a Wife to ſay,</hi> He doth not love me, therefore I will not obey him; <hi>for not the Husbands affections to her, but her affection to God, muſt be her great motive to ſubjection. If the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band fails in his duty, the Wife ſuffers by it: but if ſhe fails in her duty to him, ſhe ſins in it; the former is a Croſs to the Wife, but the latter is a Curſe to her. Indeed when women pretend reaſon to reprove their Husbands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not willingly ſubmit to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting over them, they do provoke God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; for God doth not in the leaſt approve of ſuch fond fooliſh Husbands, who deliver up that dominion which God hath given them, and ſuffer their Wives to trample over it, and trample upon it. In ſuffering themſelves thus to be trampled upon, they ſuffer the Image and Glory of God to be trampled upon; their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their Wives inſulting is not kindneſs but baſeneſs, not humility but iniquity.

Therefore, I ſay, you that are Wives look well to the ground that moves you to acquaint your Husband of any miſcarriage, ſee that it be not the effect of a proud inſulting humour, out of a deſire to exerciſe dominion over them, nor the effect of a paſſionate, peeviſh humour, by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, becauſe your wills are croſſed, or that your corrupt fancies are not indulged.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Beware you do not chide your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, inſtead of admoniſhing them, for, I ſay, it is always unlawful for a Wife to chide her Husband at any time, for any thing, for the perſon chiding, according to the nature of the act, takes ſuperiority over the party chided, whereby the Wife breaks Gods order, and contradicts his Word, thereby ſhewing only the ſad effects of a furious ſpirit, manifeſting that fire of pride rageth in her, which is always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with fire of contention. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wife when ſhe ſpeaks to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of miſcarriages, ſhe muſt do it in the moſt humble manner that ſhe can, ſhe muſt always do it by way of intreaty and humble deſire. When you would admoniſh your Husbands of their ſins, or adviſe them
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:31630:112"/>about their ſpiritual eſtates, firſt beg Gods direction in, and bleſſing on, what you are about to do, then in the particular cloſe, dealing with an Husband about the evil of his way, humbly, meekly, and mildly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But many women, inſtead of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this courſe, ſcold at their Husbands, ſpeak harſhly, frowardly, and revilingly to them: Yet aſſuredly nothing more rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the paſſions of an Husband, than the irreverent, rude, audacious carriage, and chiding language of a Wife, whereby ſhe uſurps authority over him. Thus <hi>Ziporah</hi> carried it to her Husband <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was a man of God, the meekeſt man on earth, ſhe gave him harſh, chiding, and reviling language, for obſerving what God commanded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Surely a bloody Husband thou art to me.</hi> Truly ſuch Wives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s preſume to chide their Husbands, are of an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> ſpirit. Chiding words are a great offence to an Husband, &amp; if conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:31630:112"/>by the Wife upon every trifling oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, will have a mighty tendency to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate affection. For ſuch an unbecoming carriage of a Wife, under a pretence of admonition, doth but deny reverence and ſubjection to the Husband; for if Wives tell their Husbands of their faults in an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way, uſing hard and bitter words, and a ſower fretting countenance, they may provoke them, but not reform them Therefore, O Wives, be not ſo arrogant as to chide your Husbands, who by their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority have right to chide you when you miſcarry. And chiding can never be termed admoniſhing, when 'tis done by an inferiour to a ſuperiour, but rather an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant inſulting. Indeed when inferiours chide their ſuperiours, they are not like by ſo doing to effect a work of conviction on them, they may be inſtrumental of raiſing their paſſions, but not of prevailing with them to acknowledg their ſins. Let not Wives then preſume to chide their Husbands whom they are bound humbly to intreat. But when they ſpeak to their Husbands, or of their Husbands, let it be with a great deal of reſpect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Beware you do not ground your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:31630:113"/>upon falſe interpretations of your Husbands actions, &amp; judging them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form good actions from an evil principle, to a ſinful end. By this means many Wives have reviled &amp; reproached their Husbands exceedingly. This was <hi>Michals</hi> fault, ſhe irreverently rebuked <hi>David,</hi> or rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled him, <hi>for rejoycing before the Lord at the bringing home of the Ark.</hi> She chargeth him for <hi>carrying of himſelf like a vain fellow, undervaluing himſelf, and doing that which was beneath his quality, doing as fools uſe to do when they are hired to make ſport. David</hi> might ſeem to ſome to be very tart in his reply to his Wife, in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.21. Inded <hi>David</hi> had juſt cauſe to be thus ſharp, not only becauſe the flouts and inſolencies of a Wife are moſt unſufferable, but eſpecially becauſe it was his Zeal &amp; Devotion in the ſervice of God which ſhe derided. I have heard of a woman that was ſo vile as to cenſure her Husband, that when he had ſet a day apart to humble himſelf before the Lord in the ſenſe of his ſin, ſhe told him, (without any thing done or ſaid by him to raiſe her choler) <hi>That he had kept a Faſt to the Devil.</hi> And what is the reaſon that <hi>Michal</hi> and other Women thus miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret

               </gap> unbecoming carriages to their Husbands, and indeed God will deal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely with ſuch Wives, as he did with <hi>Michal: She had no child until the day of her death.</hi> Becauſe of this wickedneſs, God adjudged her to perpetual barenneſs, which was a great reproach at that time. Such as have their Husbands contemptible in their eyes, God will make them contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in every eye: God will either by barenneſs deprive them of having Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or (that which is a greater affliction) let them have weak and ſickly children, which he will quickly take from them by death or let their Children prove a ſcurge or curſe to them. <hi>O Wives! you will firſt charge your Husbands falſly with faults from a raſh, envious and wicked miſinterpreting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and then pretend cauſe to reprove them,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:31630:114"/>when the fault you charge them with is of your own forging, Therefore, O Wives! you muſt carefully beware that you do not charge your Husbands with any miſcarriages from your own malicious wreſting of the ſenſe of their words or actions; for in this you offend God highly. There are few Wives but will pretend reaſons for finding fault with their Husbands, when they can evidence none; and their contentions wranglings are the effects of putting falſe conſtructions upon their words and actions, conceiting things to be otherwiſe than in truth they are, and upon this ground they have preſumed to carry it irreverently to their Husbands. I ſay, they muſt take care of miſcarrying in this reſpect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. You muſt not preſume to admoniſh your Husbands for any thing but that which tends to deſtroy his Soul, or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh his Family: that is, for that which is a diſhonour to God, a breach of his Law, a ſtraying from the Divine Rule, or a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the duty that God requires from them; or (<hi>2dly.</hi>) a waſting of their Eſtates by miſemploying or extravagantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming them, thereby not providing for the neceſſaries of their families. For leſſer matters than theſe you are not to find fault
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:31630:114"/>with your Husbands at all: as, <hi>for geſtures of the body, for ſometimes uſing the vulgar di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alect of the Countrey in diſcourſe, not keeping their apparel in that excellent order as ſome do, or the faſhion requires, for not complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for not manifeſting a fond carriage to you, for not telling you every thing they are about to do before they act it, for not obſerving your times for ſtaying at home or going abroad, for diſcourſing with perſons of an inferiour quality, you thinking it too much beneath them, ſome innocent actions of the hand in talking, or ſuch inconſiderable trifles that are not in their own nature ſinful.</hi> I ſay, ſuch things you are not to take notice of in your Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, nor manifeſt your ſelves angry with your Husbands for them. A truly gracious Soul can very well bear with ſuch trifles in an Husband without being diſtaſted with him, and ſuch Wives as cannot do either evidence the weakneſs of their grace, or their want of grace. But there are ſome Wives of ſuch wrangling ſpirits, as that they will uſe more violent expreſſions in finding fault with ſuch trifles, than at any time they will do when their Husbands ſin againſt God Tho' they ought in a limited ſenſe &amp; due manner to admoniſh them of the ſins
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:31630:115"/>that they do commit, yet the Wife may not at any time lawfully reprove the Husband for that which is not ſinful, yet ſhe may humbly deſire him to comply with her in things indifferent if he think fit. But for a Wife to contend with an Husband about inconſiderable toys, is very unbecoming her, and the cauſe of much diſquiet in a Family. Many Wives are apt to cenſure that to be ſin in an Husband, which is not; as I can inſtance in one, that looked upon <hi>the ſighs and groans of her Husband, and the riſing and falling of his voice in Prayer, to be hypocriſie, affectation, and ſelf-conceitedneſs;</hi> when, for ought ſhe knew, they might be the effects and evidences of fervency in ſpirit: as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>We know not what we ſhould pray for, but the Spirit it ſelf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered:</hi> that is, the Spirit helpeth us to make us earneſt and fervent in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is evidenced by groanings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what can be evidenced by the bare expreſſion of the mouth; yea, groanings do evidence an ardent deſire of mind, even when we are not able to ſpeak; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that prayer which is breathed in &amp; out by the Spirit of God, cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:31630:115"/>ſome external evidences, either of voice countenance, or ſighs. Do not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that prayer which may be of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits working, and indeed were we more fervent in prayer, we ſhould manifeſt more ſighings and groanings in it. Prayer is not to be meaſured by the multitude &amp; fineneſs of words, but by the earneſt groans of the heart. Sighs and groans evidence more of the heart in prayer, than words alone; for words alone may be but bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and as the drawing nigh of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite. Conſidering this, let no woman find fault with that in an Husband, which the word of God doth not condemn in him. Tho' many of his carriages may not pleaſe her humour, yet ſhe muſt patiently bear with them, and not ſpeak againſt them, except they be ſinful, and ſhe can prove them ſo by Scripture. It is better by much to be ſilent, than to cry out againſt that which we cannot prove to be ſin by Gods word. No good is done by reproving a deed, except by Scripture the doer can be convinced of ſin.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Be careful that under pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving your Husbands, you do not utter any expreſſions that tend to the underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:31630:116"/>and contempt of your Husbands per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, parts or education; for reproachful &amp; diſgraceful words given to an Husband, will cauſe conjugal affections to decay ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much. If you reproach your Husbands when you pretend to reprove their ſins, you will break their heads inſtead of their hearts, and make them flie in your faces, inſtead of falling down at Gods feet. Some are apt to manifeſt their diſlike of being related to their Husbands as their Wives, and this is very ſinful, nay it is ſinful to wiſh ſo in their hearts, for therein they quarrel at the providence, and diſlike the appointments of God. Some will ſay to their Husbands when they are at any time croſt in their humours, <hi>If I had known this and this by thee before, as well as I do now, I would never have had thee for my Husband.</hi> Some Wives will drop expreſſions as if they deſerv'd a better Husband than they had, one richer and better than they had. Some will tell their Husbands, <hi>They had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter married ſome inferiour perſon which wou'd have better ſuted their clowniſh breeding than with them who were better educated.</hi> All which expreſſions tend to the undervaluing their Husbands perſons and education, &amp;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:31630:116"/>ſuch Wives who by their carriages &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions do thus ſlight their Husbands, are never like to convince them of ſin; they may perplex and afflict them, but not do them good. Some men are more troubled with what is ſaid to them, than what is done to them. Unfriendly and undervaluing ſpeeches have lain heavier upon them, than the heavieſt of preſſures. <hi>Job was broken in pieces with words,</hi> chap. 19.2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reproachful and reviling language hath occaſioned many ſad effects, for cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el words many times provoke to cruel acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Hard words are numbred amongſt the hardeſt tryals. <hi>If then, O Wife, under a pretence of reproving thy Husbands ſin, thou dost reproach him, and ſpeak undervaluingly of him, thou endeavoureſt to make him a ſhame and reproach to evil men, but not make him aſhamed of any ſin: and indeed ſuch reprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings will make and increaſe breaches between you; and ſuch Husbands muſt have their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſtupified, that can bear ſuch carriages from a Wife. When offenders are reproved, it is to make them aſhamed, not to ſhame them; but thoſe are reproaches, and not rebukes, that make men a ſhame, and not aſhamed. But indeed if thou doſt endeavour to caſt contempt on thy
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:31630:117"/>Husband, notwithſtanding thou may'ſt be a Profeſſor, it is an evidence that he is gracious, and thou art carnal, for none receive more contempt on earth, than they whoſe names are written in Heaven. Such as are wicked can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deſpiſe thoſe who are in eſteem with God.</hi> I knew a profeſſor of Religion, that when her Husband was ſpeaking ſomething of no great concern, he ſpeaking but one word more than ſhe thought fit or ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, ſhe fell into ſuch a rage, that ſhe ſaid <hi>he was worſe than the Devil of Hell,</hi> and yet pleaded in her juſtification, <hi>She muſt ſpeak againſt ſin, and that he was a vile fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and ſhe could not make him worſe than he was;</hi> and yet ſhe could not ſay that any thing he ſpoke was ſinful. But tho' ſome Wives in their paſſions ſpeak to and of their Husbands as if they were the vileſt of men, yet when God doth viſit them with a violent fit of ſickneſs, or any other ſore affliction, they will ſometimes acknowledg that they have wronged them, and deſire them to pardon their unbecoming carriage towards them. 'Tis ſad when ſuch as are no relations do revile and reproach a man, and ſpeak contemptibly of him: but 'tis more ſad to be reviled and reproached by
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:31630:117"/>a Wife, and no reaſon or pretence that ſhe can bring can poſſibly excuſe her ſo doing. 'Tis a grief to hear thoſe that are vile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile and throw dirt in their faces, whoſe faces ſhine thro' that beauty and comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which God hath put upon them: but to ſee a Wife throw dirt in the face of her Husband who is gracious, and beſpatter and bemire his credit, is very ſad and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, neither can the vileneſs that the Wife may pretend to be in her Husband, if he were really as bad as ſhe aſſerts him to be, juſtifie her in reviling of him; for the Husbands faultineſs is no good plea for the Wifes miſcarriage. God doth permit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious Husbands to be thus reviled by their Wives, to exerciſe their graces, that their patience may have its perfect work, and that they may not idolize ſuch Relations. Indeed ſuch Wives as drop ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions tending to the undervaluing of their Husbands, by ſpeaking contemptibly of them, they loath their very perſons. I heard of one, (and I ſuppoſe I knew her) that ſaid to her Husband, <hi>Thou art a ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fellow, I cannot bear the ſmell of thy breath 'tis ſo offenſive, unpleaſant, noiſom, and ill-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury to me.</hi> So her Husband might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:31630:118"/>as <hi>Job</hi> did, chap 19.17. <hi>My breath was ſtrange to my Wife:</hi> that is, did ſeem loathſom to my Wife. Firſt, that which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon his breath, his word or voice, his ſpeech or complaint. Words are nothing but breath formed and ſhaped to expreſs our minds by: ſo then <hi>my breath was ſtrange</hi> (that is, my words, my complaints) <hi>to her;</hi> my diſcourſes with her are ſtrange, ſhe will not hear me ſpeak, my voice is offenſive and unpleaſant to her. <hi>2dly.</hi> Take breath for that which we reſpire or breath forth while we live, that is loathſom and unſavory to her, as unſavoury meat which the ſtomach loatheth, and cannot digeſt. Yet I muſt tell you the virtue of ſome Wives have appeared gloriouſly, that when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes have made all others loath their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, they have delighted in them; and while true conjugal love lives, there will be no contempt of one anothers perſons, no loathing one another for any bodily imperfections. But indeed this ſame wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man that loathed Husbands breath, did in <hi>Job</hi> 2.9 bid him <hi>curſe God, and die.</hi> Truly then her breath was ſtrange to him, becauſe 'twas a ſinful breath. And ſuch as by any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ys manifeſt a contempt of their <hi>Husbands</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:31630:118"/>have ſuch a principle in them as <hi>Job's</hi> Wife had; therefore beware that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reproving your Husbands you do not ſpeak revilingly to them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Be careful that under pretence of finding fault with your Husbands miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, you do not reveal your Husbands weakneſſes unto others, but hide their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities as much as you can. Whatever right you have to admoniſhing your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, certainly you have no right to do it before others: for then you will divulge their failings to others, which by no means you ought to do; neither would you ever preſume to do it, if you had dear love for them, <hi>for charity covereth many infirmities,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. And ſo in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.13. <hi>A tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer revealeth ſecrets, but he that is of a faithful ſpirit concealeth the matter.</hi> So in <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.12. <hi>True charity hath a garment long and large enough to cover many, yea, a multitude of ſins.</hi> Charity ought to cover the ſins of others as to the preſervation of their credit amongſt men. So then while you are admoniſhing or wiſely reproving your Husbands, you ought to conceal their faults from others, and not to publiſh and blaze them abroad to their ſhame, or
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:31630:119"/>to the Provocation of Paſſion in them and it is a great peice of Chriſtiam Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſo to do, and may be a means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering them from the Power and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of their Sins. O Wives! you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times talk of the Actions of your Husbands, to make ſport for your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and ſay you meant no hurt, you did it only in jeſt, and by way of diverſion, or to make him aſham'd of his indiſcreet Actions, I ſay ſuch diſcoverings of your Husbands Actions are directly ſinful and your relating of any failings or haſty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate expreſſions of your Husbands unto others, will make all your juſt and lawful Admonitions ineffectual. You muſt be careful therefore not to utter any thing of your Hurbands unto others that may blemiſh their Reputations, prejudice or undervalue their Perſons. But if your Husbands are obſtinate or pervers in their ſins; or continue in ſuch Actions as the Scripture aſſerts to be ſinful, ſo that your lawful endeavours cannot reclaim them, or that their carriages to you, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian-like, that you are in a kind of bondage and ſlavery with them that they do oppreſs you, take Vicious Courſes;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:31630:119"/>Conſume their Eſtates, and neglect to provide neceſſaries for you contrary to the Goſpel Rule, then you may acquaint your Godly Miniſter or Paſtor, or ſome prudent judicious Chriſtian Friend, that will keep your Counſel, whom you may deſire to confer with your Husbands, and endeavour to convince them of the evil of their ways, and perſwade them to carry it more affectionately towards you. But you muſt divulge their failings in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way, you may as ſoon undergo Gods Curſs for diſcovering your Husbands na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs as your Parents, for your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands are nearer Relations to you, then your Parents. Therefore if you would do good to your Husbands by any advice and counſel that you do reſpectfully give them, do not publiſh their failings unto others.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If you would reclaim your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands from any evil way to a faithful walking in the ways of God, your order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and regular Converſation is the moſt effectual means of gaining them, and winning upon them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ye wives be in ſubjection to your own husbands, that if any obey not the word, they
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:31630:120"/>alſo may without the word be won by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the wives, which they behold your chaſt converſation coupled with fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> By this means they might by Gods bleſſing prevail with their Husbands to conform to the Goſpel Rule, when they can mark nothing but chaſtity and holineſs to their Wives Converſations. Now winning Converſation doth conſiſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In a Reverend Eſteem of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as one placed by the Lord in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Superiority above her. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ye Wives be in Subjection to your own Husbands, for know that the Sin of an Husband doth not exempt the Wife from her duty, but rather tie her the more ſtrictly to the duty of Subjection. Wicked Husbands obſerving the dutiful carriage of their Wives to them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they have been very unkind to their Wives, will be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome excellency in Religion, that doth enable them ſo to do, ſo by degrees at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a liking of Religion, and endeavour to be Religious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A chaiſt Converſation coupled with Fear, as in the ſecond Verſe, there is no part of a Chriſtians Converſation ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:31630:120"/>to gain others to fall in love with Religion, as that wherein the duties we owe to others in the Relation we have to them do ſhine; for theſe two; firſt, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity which is the main duty in Reference to the manifeſting of the faithfulneſs of the Wife to the Husband; and fear which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Reverence the Wife ows to the Husband as her Superior, whereby ſhe is affraid to diſpleaſe him. Theſe I ſay are the qualities of a Chriſtian Converſation which the ſpirit of God condiſcends to intimate, as moſt prevalent to gain Evil Husbands to fall in Love with Religion. When an Husband obſerves the modeſty, chaſtity and faithfulneſs of his Wife, the care ſhe hath to pleaſe him in all lawful things, and her watchfulneſs to avoid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that may diſtaſt him. It will influence him very much to like Religion, which prompts her to ſuch an obliging Converſation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In order to attaining this winning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, whereby Wives might reclaim their Husbands from ſin by their outward carriages, they ſhould take great care to attain a right frame of Spirit, <hi>to have their inward man adorned with meekneſs and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:31630:121"/>peaceableneſs of ſpirit,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. This is the way for Wives to commend Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion unto their Husbands, and to win them to fall in love with it by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriages. Their prime care muſt be exerciſed to manifeſt in me and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that their hearts are adorned with the graces of Gods Spirit, then their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations cannot but be lovely to their Husbands. This is the way of gaming ſuch a converſation, as will gain their Husbands to an holy life. Now thoſe graces in a Wife, that have the moſt powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to prevail upon her Husband are Meekneſs and Quietneſs of Spirit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Meekneſs whereby ſhe keeps down her paſſions from riſing againſt her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, tho' he wrongs her, or againſt the Lords diſpenſations in exerciſing her more hardly than others, whereby ſhe uſeth all amicable and loving ways to reclaim her Husband from continuing to deal injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with her.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Quietneſs of Spirit whereby ſhe doth eſchew all needleſs contradictions of her Husband, all raſhneſs in her Actions, all medling with things not belonging to her, all expreſſions of diſcontent with
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:31630:121"/>that lot which the Lord hath carved out to her, and ſuch carriages of a Wife will work more upon an Husbands heart then the ſtrongeſt Arguments and ſharpeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs ſhe can aſſault him with. Now the Apoſtle doth enforce this Exhortation to Wives with theſe two Arguments. The firſt is taken from the example of holy believing Women, who counted it their beſt Ornament to manifeſt their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Faith by their dutifulneſs to their Husbands, and particularly of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> who teſtified her Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to her Husband, by her Reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Reverend carriage towards him, and language to him. <hi>She obeyed him and called him Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. The ſecond Argument is from the advantage of ſuch a carriage, and ſuch a winning Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that if they did immitate theſe Holy Women, eſpecially <hi>Sarah</hi> in duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to her Husband, notwithſtanding any wrongs they might receive from them, they ſhould prove themſelves Heirs of <hi>Sarah,</hi> bleſſedneſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> when we obtain Grace from the Lord to follow the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtepts of the Saints Regiſtred in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially in the Faithful diſcharge
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:31630:122"/>of the duties of our perticular Stations and Relations, then do we prove our ſelves to have a right to be made perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſame ſpiritual priviledges with them; and Heirs of the ſame Eternal Bleſſedneſs which they now poſſeſs. So Wives behaving themſelves to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in a Dutiful, Reſpectful, Reverential way, manifeſting a chaſt Converſation coupled with fear, having their hearts in a gracious frame adorned with meekneſs and quietneſs of ſpirit, they will clear up to themſelves their right to <hi>Sarahs</hi> Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and enjoy the ſence of their intereſt in the ſpiritual priviledges that ſhe had; &amp; by their meek and quiet Converſations be very prevalent to win their Husbands from the error of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ways. When God by the Spirit hath huſht the ſtorms and tempeſts that uſually ariſe in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Wives, when he breaths upon them with a favourable wind, and ſtills their Spirits, and reſtrains Satan the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of miſrule, that he doth not kindle Jealouſies and Animoſities in their Spirits, but that they have a ſpiritual quietneſs of heart and tranquility of mind wrought in them by the ſweet breathings of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:31630:122"/>ſpirit, which they can retain when they have the higheſt Provocations from their Husbands to unquietneſs; then they will have a mighty influence upon their Husbands, to reclaim them from their Vicious Actions and violent paſſions. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Children of the Lord be bound to deal with thoſe with whom they live or converſe, that they obſerve to ſin by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and conference, commending Chriſt to them, and opening the evil of ſin to them, and their dangerous State if they remain impenitent, the neceſſity of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lives and entertaining Chriſt in their hearts by faith: Yet it is mainly a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſuitable to the word of God, that God uſeth to bleſs to make men fall in love with Religion, without which the beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will rather harden them in ſin, than reclaim them from their ſinful ways. Then I ſay do Wives ſtop the mouths of their Husbands, when their converſations for Piety unto God, and Righteouſneſs unto them is ſuch as may diſcover unto their Husbands their failings, and point out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that good way wherein they oug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O let Wives ſhine as lights in the world, holy, blameleſs, and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and by their practice hold forth the word of life unto their Husbands, ſo that by a ſutable practice joyned with their profeſſions, Wives will be the ſame to their Husbands in order to their convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſcovery of their Sin, and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the lovely beauty of the ways of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs, as the Sun &amp; Moon is in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſcovering things hidden by natural darkneſs 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15, 16. And indeed this is the principal way that wives can law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully take to help on the Reformation of their Husbands. This I ſay is their moſt proper courſe, and will help on their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands amendment, when harſh biteing and ſmart words will make them worſe both to God and them. Indeed the Wife
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:31630:123"/>beſt Counſel will ſignifie nothing to the Husbands good without a regular, meek and quiet Converſation. Therefore in order to the perſwading of an Husband from ſin let the Wife take care to order her Converſation aright. Conſider then O Wives: have you cauſe to complain, that none of your endeavours have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved effectual in order to your Husbands Reformation? But have you not taken a wrong Method to effect it? Have you not manifeſted too much bitterneſs in ſpeaking againſt your Husbands failings? have you not manifeſted too much rage and violence when they have croſſed your humour in ſome domeſtick concerns? Have you not ſpoken to them in a fierce, furious and irreverent manner? Then blame your own paſſions as the cauſe of your Husbands Obſtinacy, were you more milde and reſpectful in your carriages to them, they would be more complying with you, if you would then do them good by your advice, adviſe them in an humble and meek way.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If you would do your Husbands good by your Admonitions, be careful that you never admoniſh them, but when they are in a good moode or very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:31630:124"/>humour, if a work be not done in a proper ſeaſon, it were better not done at all, when you find them in a good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as ſometimes the worſt of men will be, then manifeſt the dear affection that you have for them, tell them what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regard you have for their Eternal good, their preſent Reputation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Then uſe ſuch perſwaſive argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as may be moſt taking with their Conſtitutions, ſtill carrying your ſelves with all due reſpect and ſubmiſſion to their Authority over you, and if you cannot prevail with them to Reform, then when you find them alone; tell them once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of their faults in an humble, modeſt and meek manner, even weeping, as the Apoſtle ſpoak to the <hi>Philipians,</hi> Chap. 3.18. <hi>And now I tell you even weeping,</hi> this hath proved a moſt effectual and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing way when all other means have failed.</p>
            <p>But it is ſtrange to ſee what Violence and Fury of Spirit ſome do manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of reproving their Husbands miſcarriages. If their Husbands do but walk abroad about their lawful occaſſions, even ſuch as concern the providing for
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:31630:124"/>the maintenance of their Familys, if they have any frivolous matters that they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to imploy them about, which doth not in the leaſt belong to them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it muſt be done then, and only then, when their honeſt and lawful occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions do call them abroad, and then if their Husbands will not gratifie them in laying aſide their buſineſs to gratifie their peeviſh inſulting humours they will cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their going forth to be ungodly and deviliſh, and that they ſpend their time in ungodly Company, that they hope God will ſtop their going forth in a ſhort time, and wiſh that they were ſome way ſmitten of God to be conſtrained to ſtay within, and continue their reviling lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as long as they abide in company with them, ſometime aſſerting them to be Hypocrites, at other times, aſſert them to be Prophane, and all this ſuch Wives do becauſe their Husbands will not be as Subject to them as an Apprentice is to his Maſter, they will complain if they have not all things according to their mind, &amp; yet ſtorm at their Husbands, uſing lawful endeavours to provide them. If their Husbands have no buſineſs abroad,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:31630:125"/>How are they provided for? How have they a ſupply of all things neceſſary for their maintenance? they cannot prove their Husbands keep bad Company, or that they are frequenters of Taverns, or Ale-Houſes, or concerned in extravigant Expences, yet talk to them, and of them no otherwiſe then as to, and of a Rogue that is going from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Tyburne,</hi> I appeal to all the Profeſſors of Religion in the Kingdom, whether they can conceive any Grace to be in the Hearts of ſuch Wives, and whether they do not carry themſelves as ſuch as are acted by ſome infernal Fury. Let them pretend what they will, and if in truth their Husbands were as vile as their furious Tongues do declare, yet they cannot Juſtifie their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent carriages, nor juſtifie the Omiſſion of manifeſting that Reſpect and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which according to Gods word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> owe them, as they are their Husbands, ſo long as the Relation continues their Relational Dutys continue, and they ought to ſubmit to their Husbands ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, though it doth not pleaſe them. Therefore let not Wives pretend that to be done in Zeal for God, which is but diſgor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:31630:125"/>the ſcum and froth a furious Spirit.</p>
            <p>But there are many gracious Wives who are not of this furious temper, but abhor ſuch furious carriages, who live very comfortably with their Husbands, they are dutiful and reſpectful to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and their Husbands are loving and kind to them, and they have much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ſatisfaction, delight and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in each other. There are no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention between them; what the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band orders, the Wife cheerfully ſubmits unto. She owns him for her head, for her guide, for her governour, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes not to inſult over him, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict or controule him, and by this means there is a ſweet harmony between them, and they are Comforts and Bleſſings to each other.</p>
            <p>I come now to the laſt particular, wherein I ſhall ſpeak to both Husbands and Wives together, and perſwade them to be more careful to carry themſelves more Chriſtian like to their Children and Servants, which will be a ſpecial means to preſerve peace and concord amongſt themſelves. Certainly one reaſon why
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:31630:126"/>Husbands and Wives do not live comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably together, is their neglecting to give their Children a Pious Education, which through Divine aſſiſtance might be a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means to heal the vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ions. God in judgment permits Husbands &amp; Wives to be plagues to each other, who neglect by education <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o refine and reform their Children, and make them pliable to the Divine Will, who are rugged and untoward by nature; for if an Husband be not tender of a regular carriage to his inferiours, he will never be tender of a dutiful carriage to God. And if the Wife doth not carry her ſelf as ſhe ought to her Children and Servants, ſhe will never carry her ſelf as ſhe ought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her Husband, nor have any tender care to promote Gods honour. If Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Wives did better diſcharge their duties to their inferiours, they would live more peaceably with each other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall give them ſome directions how they ſhould carry themſelves to inferiours in general, and then give ſome particular directions how they ought to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Children in reſpect of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and correction.</p>
            <pb n="195" facs="tcp:31630:126"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Concerning their carriage to inferiours in general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let Husbands and Wives be careful not to be too haſty or ſudden in charging faults on their Children, Servants, or other inferiours. For ſudden ſurprizes do put them by all due conſideration, that many times they ſpeak what otherwiſe they would not. Therefore give them time to conſider what to anſwer, and adviſe them to ſpeak the truth tho' againſt themſelves, telling them, <hi>That a lye will double their fault, and greatly encreaſe their guilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In reproving your inferiours, manage your reproofs ſo prudently that you may manifeſt <hi>love to their perſons</hi> when you evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the <hi>diſlike of their ſins.</hi> Begin gently to uſe all perſuaſive motives to reclaim them from ſin, and allure them to the ways of God. Never uſe ſeverity but in caſes of flat neceſſity, leſt the too frequent exerciſe of ſeverity make them to deſpiſe you, and harden them againſt you. When you mix ſome ſevere expreſſions of holy anger againſt their ſin, let it be done in a grave prudent way; for when you deal with them in a boiſterous way, you only put them into a ſlaviſh fear. Let them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:31630:127"/>that you are more diſpleaſed with them for o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Pray let not your paſſions, like <hi>unruly torrents,</hi> overflow the banks that are limitted by Scripture and Reaſon. A grave carriage, and a ſober moderate anger, will procure reverence, and advance reformations; but that which is mix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oweth from the breaſt of fools. A Child can never perſuade himſelf that ſuch anger proceedeth from love, when he is made the ſink to receive the daily diſgorgements of a cholerick ſtomach, when the unhappy neceſſity of his relation ties him to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the way, where an angry diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt vent and empty it ſelf. If you that <hi>rule</hi> be thus <hi>unruly,</hi> how can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect your inferiours to be regular, when your uncomely demeanour doth almoſt convince them that love can hardly be the genuine root of your anger, but that they are made the ſad objects of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive temper, and that your reprehenſions are ſpic'd with hatred. If you have cauſe to be angry, yet let not your ſtorms run all upon the Rocks, but endeavour ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to cool the inflamation, to abate
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:31630:127"/>the feaver, and ſlack the fire of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

            <p n="4">4. Beware that you do not reprove your inferiours to gratifie a froward &amp; perverſe humour. Your aims &amp; intentions muſt be upright in reproving. Take heed of ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any wildfire of price, vain-glory, and ambitious humour of contradicting and controuling others, with your zeal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving. Let your rebukes be purely for

Therefore beware when you reprove the faults of inferiours, that you do not multiply words, for in a multitude of words, there will be many impertinencies which nouriſh contentions, and rather bring contempt upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover, than reform the reproved.

The dogged carriages of your ſuperiours, with a word and a blow to Children and Servants upon every trifling occaſion, works in them an over-much ruſtick ſlavery, makes them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:31630:129"/>dull, and ſtupid, and unfit for any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Carry your ſelves therefore in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they may neither fear or have your moroſity, nor grow wanton upon the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your carriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Be careful not to manifeſt too much ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt a fault when 'tis ingeniouſly and fully confeſt, for if you do, you will cauſe your Children and Servants to deny the truth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. When ſuperiours are equally ſevere when their inferiours confeſs, as when they deny the truth of the fact, they provoke them to lye. If a confeſſion of a fault doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a moderation of correction, yea ſometimes an omiſſion of correction, another time inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours will obſtinately deny what they have done, and add ſin to ſin. And let ſuch ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours know, that they are guilty of every ſuch lye their inferiours tell, and ſhall anſwer for it as their own ſin.</hi>

            <p>I have here given thoſe general dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions how Husbands und Wives ſhould carry themſelves to their inferiours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their diſorderly carriages to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants have cauſed hot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts between them. When the one hath fallen fiercely upon a Child or Servant, the other hath diſliked it, and thereupon
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:31630:130"/>have fallen out with each other, and have been ſo furious againſt each other, that they have not been reconciled in a long time. Therefore, O Husbands and Wives, as you deſire to have a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enjoyment of each other, obſerve thoſe directions in your carriages to your inferiours</p>
            <p>But I paſs on to the next particular, <hi>to give ſome particular directions to Husbands and Wives concerning the education of their Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Beware of manifeſting your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to one Child more than another, but ſhew equal love to them all, otherwiſe that will be an heinous crime in one, which will ſeem no blemiſh or fault in the other. For an unequal affection blinds the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the child that is reſpected, is dealt harſher with, whereby it is very much diſcouraged, dejected, and grieved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do not overmuch reſtrain them from innocent and lawful recreations but give them ſome convenient liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelves in the exerciſe of them, which may better diſpoſe them to receive benefit by your education, and be a means the ſooner to make your godly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to them.</p>
            <pb n="199" facs="tcp:31630:130"/>
            <p n="3">3. Beware of baſe vilifying language in your rebukes, which will provoke Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be dogged, ſullen, and grow worſe rather than reform them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Do you ſometimes wink at ſmall things in Children, and not chide them for every trifle, elſe as Children grow older, Parents will grow contemptible.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let not the Mother chide or correct the Child in the Fathers preſence; but if the Father doth not obſerve the preſent ill behaviour, or know of a former miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, let the Wife then inform the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, whoſe right then it is to chide or correct by the authority of his place, or deal with the Child when the Father is gone forth, for otherwiſe ſhe doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect her Husbands ſuperiority over her ſelf as well as the Child.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Uſe not many words in rebuking your Children. Let your words be few, proper and weighty, and let your carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age be grave, but not fierce.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Do not upbraid your Children with former miſcarriages in your paſſionate heats, for which they have received re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof and correction before, but when the ſame faults are again renewed, give
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:31630:131"/>new reproofs or corrections, as the nature of the offence doth require.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Study the conſtitutions of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Mildneſs will do better with ſome, than ſeverity, and the diſpoſitions of others need ſeverity to be exerciſed towards them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. When the Husband rebukes a Child, let the Wife be ſilent, and not plead for him in the childs hearing: If the Husband doth what is not proper, let her tell him of it in private.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If you are angry with Children for ſome miſcarriage, forbear rebuking or correcting, till your ſpirits are cooled. That cannot be done regularly that is done in fury. Whatever is done raſhly will be done diſorderly, and ſo no good effect can be produced.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Be careful that you be not cauſers of your childrens undultifulneſs and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience by your bad examples and ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. If you have not walked ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly as the duties of your Children might be due unto you, even in regard of your behaviour you have brought on your ſelves the guilt of your Childrens want of duty. You ſhould be holy, grave
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:31630:131"/>and modeſt in your lives, and eminently exemplary for practical godlineſs, and then your inſtructions will more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally influence their hearts, and breed and continue in them an awe and reverence of your parental authority. But alas! in how many places are Parents of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and looſe lives, of peeviſh and froward humours, bewraying their neglect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, going to Religious Exerciſes when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſt, making every trifling occaſion a ſufficient excuſe for neglecting Chriſtian duties, ſometimes pretending inability of body, when lazineſs and want of affection is the principal cauſe of their neglects! Others carry no gravity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n their doings, nor modeſty in their behaviours, but live moſt diſſolutely, and often incontinently. Others ſwear fearfully without regard, ſpeaking profanely, not reſpecting the frailty of the youth that hear them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Husbands and Wives let unkind ſpeeches paſs from them one towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the preſence of their Children, to the great impairing of their credit with them. Other Parents are too careleſs of bringing up their Children <hi>in the fear of God, in the nature and admonition of the

               </gap> reverence to their Parents, and to tempt them to ſin; and tho' you may be grieved that your Children want a reverend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of you, yet your ſelves have been cauſers of the ſame. <hi>Pray then conſider. O ye Parents, what cauſe ye have given of y ur Childrens diſobedience, and bewail it, and be watchful againſt ſuch carriages for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as have heretofore occaſion'd their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; for ſurely what duties the Law bindeth all Children to perform, it as ſtrictly bindeth all Parents to deſerve. The Parents evil doth not at all excuſe the Childs miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, but it maketh him guilty of his Childs offence. Beg then of God to pardon your paſt miſcarriages, and to work ſuch gracious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in you, that you may never more be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents in ſin to your Children, that you may not by your bad examples draw them into the ways of their ruine. Your labouring by an holy life to deſerve duty from your Children, will exceedingly forward your Childrens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their duties in you. So that it is your great concern to beware of ſpeaking or doing any thing before your Children, that you would not have them to imitate you in; for
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:31630:132"/>Children are more forward to imitate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of their Parents in things that are evil, than in things that are good. Therefore be pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of good to them, be patterns of meekneſs, and not of wrath, that they may obſerve that in your behaviours that deſerves their imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo may be followers of you in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. O that Parents would ſtrictly obſerve thoſe directions, that their Children may be piouſly educated, whereby they may be able to take comfort in their modeſt, reſpectful, and orderly behaviour towards them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. Abuſe not your parental authority by provoking your Children to wrath, or by imbittering their Spirits, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.4. And this is done,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By denying them that which is their due, in Food, Raiment, or means of Education, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to bring them up in an honeſt Calling, whereby they might get their living in the fear of God,</hi> Lament. 4, 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By commanding them to do things unjuſt in themſelves, as in</hi> 1 Sam. 20.31. <hi>or by unjuſt and rigorous commands about things in their own nature indifferent,</hi> 1 Sam. 14.28, 29. <hi>You lay great burthens upon your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, preſſing them ſtill with your authority. You injoyn them what you liſt, not weighing
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:31630:133"/>well what they like, and not carefully conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as well their natures, as your own deſires, as well their comfort and convenient being, as your own affection and will to have it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by your Childrens lives are very much imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>By inveighing with bitter w rds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, giving them furious ſpeeches and violent language, chiefly when there is no cauſe, as</hi> Saul <hi>did to</hi> Jonathan, 1 Sam. 20.30.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>By beating them unjuſtly when there is no fault,</hi> 1 Sam. 20.33. <hi>or immoderately, unreaſonably and baſely, when there is a fault, doing it with bitterneſs without compaſſion, inſtruction, and prayer. Theſe unnatural car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages exceedingly provoke Children to wrath, and thereby your Children are provoked by you to ſin; for Children cannot bear cruel injuries from their very Parents, without being inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby to ſinful anger. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith,</hi> Provoke not your Children to anger: <hi>yet I ſay, Parents are not to with hold ſeaſonable, neceſſary, and moderate cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from their Children, although the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Parents ought to take care of their Childrens Souls, faithfully indeavouring to beat down ſin in them by nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or correction, and uſing all means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bring them up for Sons and Daughters to the Lord Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. When ever you reprove, inſtruct, when ever you find fault with any evil your Children have done, inform them of ſome good, that they ſhould be doing. There are many that are apt to be much in reproving faults that are ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver teaching duties. The Wife thinks it her ſpecial priviledge to check, and the Fathers duty only to teach; yet when they are teaching them, Wives will quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with their Husbands for not giving better inſtructions to their Children; but will not allow their Husbands to ſpeak to them in their preſence, or they will find fault with the matter or manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:31630:134"/>Indeed while Children are young, the duty of teaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them is more incumbant on the Wife then the Husband; for while the Wife keeps in her place, and as ſhe ought to be. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.15. A keeper at home, ſhe is moſt converſant with them, and hath moſt oportunities of converſing with them by way of Inſtruction, the good Wife that <hi>Solomon</hi> mentions in <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.26. <hi>She opened her mouth with wiſdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindneſs. She looketh well to the ways of her houſhould.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe are far from having a law of kindneſs in their tongues, who are ſtill caſting forth in their Expreſſions the filth of their froward minds, and that Wife is far from carrying her ſelf as a Chriſtian Parent that is always raging againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended faults, but never giving loving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions or good adviſe or counſel. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ought to be giving pious inſtructions to their Children, when there is no cauſe of reproof, they ought to inſtruct every day, but reprove them only when an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is committed. Inſtruction is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable when there is no need of reproof;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:31630:134"/>but reproof is never profitable without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. When a fault is reproved, the evil of it muſt be ſhewn to the Child of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, and the neceſſity if deſiſting, and the danger of continuing ſuch a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice muſt be demonſtrated, and how the Child ought to behave himſelf in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards God and them muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated. If Husband and Wife were faithful in this reſpect, there would not be ſuch jarrings and contentions between them as there are.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Before you inſtruct or correct Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Servants, beg God to direct you how to manage your inſtructions and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and to ſanctifie them to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifit, you cannot expect God to ſucceed that; which you do not beg God to bleſs. Inſtructions are ſo often given without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, becauſe ſo often given without Prayer, and your Corrections are ſo often given in paſſion, that they are ſeldom given with moderation, and the gratifying of paſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s oftner the ground of Correction then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, becauſe angry ſuperiors will not allow themſelves time to pray before they do correct. So that is made an act of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:31630:135"/>raſhneſs, which ſhould be an act of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. You complain of your inferiors ſtubbornneſs, Children and Servants are ſtubborn, your inſtruction and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection doth influence them very little, but when did you make a ſolemn work by ſolemn, or ejaculatory Prayer, before you entred upon it? Blame your neglects of duty to God, as the ground of your riors neglect of duty to you.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If Wives would live in peace and amity with their Husbands, if any of of them are married to a man that had Children by a former Wife, let ſuch a Wife beware that ſhe do not vilifie her Children in law, nor repreſent every Childiſh act as an Abomination, when ſhe cannot evidence them to be poſſitively ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Some Wives will exclaim againſt their Children in Law for very trifles, accuſe them to their Husbands as gulty of ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs and rudeneſs to incenſe their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands againſt them, and if they cannot influence their Husbands to be dogged to them or if their Husbands will not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and encourage their harſh deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them, they contend with their
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:31630:135"/>Hesbands and will not permit them to end joy any quiet in their Families. I ſay if ſuch Wives cannot by any of their ſubtile contrivances and unjuſt complaints prevail with their Husbands to withdraw their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from them, they will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their affections from their Husbands and refuſe to give them any conjugal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. They approve of no Servants but ſuch as will make complaints againſt their Children in the law, and concur with them in villifying of them, and ſuch a courſe hath been the cauſe much diſcord between Husbands and Wives. Indeed it is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-laws prudence to wink at many Childiſh faults in her Husbands Children by a former Wife, and not aggravate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very failing in them. Let Mother-in-laws know that they cannot juſtly claim a right to exerciſe equal Authority over them as over Children born of their own bodies, becauſe not ſo nearly related to them, yea not related to them at all by blood, and notwithſtanding what ſome Mother-in-laws have aſſerted, yet it cannot be thought true; that they are ſo much Mothers to their Children in Law, as they are Wives to their Husbands: becauſe their chiefeſt
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:31630:136"/>right of authority over their Children in law doth ariſe from their Husbands Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them to their charge and Tuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and their own taking charge of them by vertue of the ſaid Reſignation.</p>
            <p>For the Mother-in-laws authority over the Children that are not born of her own body, is derived from her Husband, and conferred on her by her Husband, and as ſhe hath not an equal authority over her own Children as her Husband hath, who is her ſuperior by Gods appointment, much leſs over her Children in law. 'Tis true as in the abſence of the Husband, the Wife is principally concerned in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Family, and Children in law are Members of the Family, in that reſpect the Mother-in-law hath the ſame authority over them, as other Members of the Family. Therefore let all Mother-in-laws conſider Docter <hi>Harris,</hi> his laſt advice to his Wife. If you marry again, remember your own obſervation, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Husbands are very uxorious, ſecond Wives very prevalent, and therefore take heed that you do no ill office in eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your Husband from his natuaral
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:31630:136"/>Children, and kindred; you ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by draw upon him a great ſin, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if you kill in him natural affections. Wherefore if Mothers-in-law are ſo Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and the fury of their Spirits is ſo raiſed, that they will exerciſe more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over their Children in law, then their Husbands are willing to allow them; to preſerve the peace of the Family, it is the Husbands prudence to place his firſt Wives Children in other Famlies, where they may be piouſly educated, and that Wife hath no regard to the glory of God nor the honour of Religion that will ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, if the Husband be able to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in other Families. The Apoſtle preſſeth all to <hi>follow after the things that make for peace. Rom.</hi> 14.19. This Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation doth concern the peace of Families as well as the peace of the Church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever doth neceſſarily tend to preſerve peace between ſuch near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as Husband and Wife muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully followed, and whatever tends to be get ſtrife and contention between them muſt be carefully avoided; for ſuch fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Perſons as are promoters of diſcord God hates. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.13.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:31630:137"/>Therefore obſerve theſe following cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Beware of being diſcontented with the condition or relation in which God hath placed you, for nothing doth more aim the Glory of God, more deſtroy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t out your Comforts then diſcontent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beware of looking on one another with a diſdainful eye, as if each of you did conceive your ſelf to excel, and were ſuperior in worth to the other, for by having one another in contempt, you can never live peaceably together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Beware of neglecting acts of conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal love for that will breed ſtrangeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you. By this means ſuch as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore lay in one anothers boſoms, are grown ſo ſtrange, that they cannot ſtay with content in one anothers ſight they will ſcarce look upon one another; who not long ſince profeſſed dearly to love one another. 'Tis ſad, yea very ſad, that they who ſhould be ready to die for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can hardly live with one another! Oh when will the love of many ſuch Relations which hath waxen cold, gather heat again? Were it not monſtrious that one Member of the body ſhould withdraw ffices of

So it is ſtrange that Husband and Wife ſhould ſuſpend the exerciſes of love to each other, that are as nearly allied as one Member of the body to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe unnatural diſtances between Husbands and Wives are to open to be hid or denied. And it is not a reproach to Chriſtianity, that ſuch as are one fleſh, ſhould act as if they were not Members of the ſame World. If then you would live peaceably together, beware of ſuſpending Acts of Love to each other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Beware you do not reproach one another, for reproaches do make breaches, if one Friend do reproach another, there will be a breach of their Friendſhip, for bitter and calumniating words do very much vex our ſpirits, and uſually the chiefeſt cauſes of diſcord between you.—Wherefore I pray conſider that Husbands and Wives continuing in ſtrangeneſs to each other makes them at laſt become guilty of burnings and bitterneſs of ſpirit one againſt another, it will not only cauſe them to forbear the manifeſtations of kindneſs to each other, but to be cruel, and deviſe evil one againſt another. Therefore let me
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:31630:138"/>perſwade you to love each other with a love of complacency. Let your delight be ſet on each other, and let all the lines of your affections be centred in each other. <hi>i.e.</hi> Let not every trifling occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on quench the flames of your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but let the heat and height of your love be placed upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beyond your Children and other Friends. When ſuch Relations decline in their love, they incline to hatred. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal love being ill digeſted, or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, turns to the greateſt enmity. Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Wives are under the cloſeſt obligations to love. Now, the cloſer any obligation is, the wider is the breach when once the obligation is broken or miſimproved. If the Wife, whom the Husband dearly loved, begins to fall from him, or forſake his bed, ſhe uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally falls out with him. There hath been ſad experience of this, and 'tis an argument where it happens, that ſuch Wives did never love their Husbands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Goſpel-principles, or in obedience to Gods command, for as they who turn againſt the Truths of God, never received them in love, ſo ſhe never in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:31630:138"/>reality embraced her Husband in love, who turns againſt him: for when grace is the cement of affections, nothing can divide them. Certainly if Husbands and Wives would faithfully endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the directions that I have given them concerning their carriages to each other, and to their Children and Servants, they would live more peaceably and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably together than they now do. 'Tis their unfaithfulneſs in relational duties that occaſions much of their Diſcord. You Wives that pretend reaſons for your contendings with your Husbands, and for your angry inſulting language, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to inform your ſelves more fully of the nature of your relational duties, how you ought to carry it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your Husbands, and to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, and endeavour a faithful diſcharge of thoſe duties, and you will quickly find a better agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you. Thus I have ended what I have to ſay on this ſubject.</p>
